## Tweets (X/Twitter)

### Tweet 1 — The Announcement
```
Something's coming.

After 10+ years bridging design and engineering, I'm packaging everything I know into a course.

Design Engineer — the role that's eating both disciplines.

Waitlist open soon. 👀
```

### Tweet 2 — The Problem
```
The gap between "design" and "development" is a lie.

The best products are built by people who refuse to accept that handoff.

Building something to help more people cross that bridge.
```

### Tweet 3 — The Tease
```
What if you could:

→ Design with engineering constraints in mind
→ Build with design sensibility in your code
→ Ship faster because you don't need to wait for "the other team"

That's what Design Engineers do.

Course drops soon.
```

### Tweet 4 — The Origin Story
```
I used to be a designer who was terrified of code.

Then I became an engineer who forgot how to design.

Finding the middle path changed everything.

Now I'm teaching it.
```

### Tweet 5 — Social Proof Setup
```
"Should I learn design or engineering first?"

Wrong question.

The right question: "How do I learn to think in both simultaneously?"

Been working on something to answer this properly. Almost ready.
```

### Tweet 6 — The Counter-Narrative
```
Hot take: Most "learn to code" courses teach you to be a bad engineer.

Most "learn design" courses teach you to be a mediocre designer.

What if we taught people to be exceptional at the intersection?

👀
```

### Tweet 7 — The Specifics Tease
```
What's in the Design Engineer course:

- Web, iOS, AND Android tracks
- Design fundamentals that engineers skip
- Engineering fundamentals that designers skip
- The "convergence" layer nobody teaches

Launching very soon.
```

### Tweet 8 — The Struggle
```
Spent 6 months asking: "What do I wish someone had taught me 10 years ago?"

The answer became a 150+ lesson course.

Design engineering isn't a trend. It's how software should always have been built.
```

### Tweet 9 — The Urgency
```
Design Engineer roles have increased 400% in the last 3 years.

Companies finally realised: the best products come from people who don't respect the design/dev boundary.

Course launches next week. Waitlist link in bio.
```

### Tweet 10 — Launch Day
```
It's live.

The Design Engineer Course — everything I know about building at the intersection of design and code.

3 tracks. 150+ lessons. Web, iOS, Android.

Whether you're a designer learning to code or an engineer learning to design — this is for you.

## LinkedIn Posts

### LinkedIn 1 — The Professional Announcement
```
I'm building something I wish existed 10 years ago.

After a decade working as a Design Engineer — that hybrid role that sits between design and development — I've noticed a pattern:

The most impactful people in tech aren't specialists. They're translators.

They speak design. They speak code. And they ship things that would take two separate teams twice as long.

I'm packaging everything I've learned into a comprehensive course.

Design Track → For engineers who want design intuition
Engineering Track → For designers who want to code confidently  
Convergence → For those ready to operate at the intersection

Web. iOS. Android.

More details coming soon. If this resonates, I'd love to hear from you in the comments.

#DesignEngineering #ProductDesign #SoftwareEngineering #CareerDevelopment
```

### LinkedIn 2 — The Problem Statement
```
There's a £100,000 problem in tech hiring.

Companies are desperately searching for people who can both design AND build. They're calling them "Design Engineers" or "Creative Technologists" or "Product Engineers."

The job postings are increasing. The salaries are premium. But the talent pipeline is empty.

Why? Because our education system still treats design and engineering as separate disciplines.

Design schools don't teach code.
Engineering programmes don't teach aesthetics.
Bootcamps optimise for speed, not depth.

I've spent the last 6 months building something to fix this.

A course that doesn't ask you to choose a lane — but teaches you to drive on both.

Launching soon. Very excited about this one.

What would you want to see in a Design Engineering curriculum? I'm still refining the final modules.

#DesignEngineering #TechCareers #ProductDevelopment #Learning
```

### LinkedIn 3 — The Personal Story
```
10 years ago, I was a designer who couldn't ship my own ideas.

I'd create beautiful mockups, hand them to developers, and watch them come back... different. Compromised. "That's not technically possible" became my least favourite phrase.

So I learned to code.

Then something unexpected happened: I became a better designer.

Understanding constraints made my designs more elegant, not less. Knowing what was hard made me creative about what was easy.

This loop — design informing code, code informing design — is what I now call Design Engineering.

It's not a job title. It's a way of thinking.

I'm turning this into a course. 150+ lessons. Design fundamentals that engineers skip. Engineering fundamentals that designers skip. The convergence layer nobody teaches.

If you've ever felt stuck on one side of the design/dev divide, this is for you.

More details very soon.

#CareerGrowth #DesignEngineering #TechSkills #ProfessionalDevelopment
```

### LinkedIn 4 — The Market Insight
```
I analysed 500 job postings with "Design Engineer" in the title.

Here's what companies actually want:

✅ Figma proficiency (but also code)
✅ React/Swift/Kotlin skills (but also taste)  
✅ Systems thinking (both design systems AND technical architecture)
✅ Prototyping (high-fidelity, in code, not just Figma)
✅ Communication (translating between disciplines)

The pattern is clear: they want hybrids.

The problem: there's no clear path to becoming one.

Most designers who "learn to code" stop at surface level.
Most engineers who "learn design" never develop real taste.

I'm building a course that goes deep on both — and more importantly, teaches the integration layer.

Because knowing Figma AND knowing React isn't enough. You need to know how to think across both simultaneously.

Launching soon. I'll share the curriculum in an upcoming post.

#DesignEngineering #TechHiring #ProductDesign #CareerDevelopment
```

### LinkedIn 5 — The Curriculum Preview
```
Here's what I'm including in the Design Engineer course:

DESIGN TRACK
→ Visual design fundamentals (typography, colour, space)
→ Platform-specific patterns (HIG for iOS, Material for Android, web conventions)
→ Design systems architecture
→ UX principles that actually matter

ENGINEERING TRACK  
→ Environment setup (the stuff tutorials skip)
→ Language fundamentals with design context
→ Component architecture
→ State management and data flow
→ Platform-specific implementation

CONVERGENCE TRACK
→ Accessibility as a first principle
→ Performance as design
→ The Design Engineer workflow
→ Building your portfolio
→ Finding (and getting) DE roles

150+ lessons across Web, iOS, and Android.

This isn't "learn to code in 30 days" or "become a designer in a weekend."

This is the comprehensive curriculum I wish existed when I started.

Launching next month. Link in comments if you want early access.

#DesignEngineering #OnlineLearning #TechEducation #ProductDesign
```

### LinkedIn 6 — The Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion: Specialisation is overrated.

The advice "go deep, not wide" made sense in the industrial age. One person, one machine, one skill.

But software isn't an assembly line.

The best products I've worked on were built by small teams of generalists who could move fluidly between problems.

Designer stuck? Engineer picks up the Figma file.
Engineer overwhelmed? Designer writes the CSS.
Nobody waiting. Nobody blocked. Just building.

This is why I believe Design Engineering is the future — not as a role, but as a mindset.

I'm building a course to help more people think this way.

Because the tech industry doesn't need more specialists waiting in their lane. It needs more people willing to cross boundaries.

Thoughts? Am I wrong here?

#DesignEngineering #TechCareers #ProductDevelopment #FutureOfWork
```

### LinkedIn 7 — The Testimonial Setup
```
I asked 50 designers and engineers one question:

"What's the biggest skill gap in your work?"

Designers said: "I wish I could prototype my ideas in real code."

Engineers said: "I wish I understood why designers make the choices they do."

Same gap. Different angles.

This is exactly what I'm building the Design Engineer course to solve.

Not just teaching designers to code.
Not just teaching engineers to design.
Teaching both to think in the language of the other.

Because the gap isn't technical. It's conceptual.

Launching soon. I'll be sharing free preview content in the coming weeks.

#DesignEngineering #ProductDesign #SoftwareEngineering #Learning
```

### LinkedIn 8 — The Process Post
```
Building this course has been humbling.

I thought I could just "write down what I know." 6 months later, I've realised:

1. Expertise is often unconscious — articulating tacit knowledge is HARD
2. What works for me might not work for others
3. The order you learn things matters more than I expected
4. Examples > explanations, every time

The course has been rewritten 3 times. The curriculum has been restructured twice. Every lesson has been reviewed for clarity.

Why am I sharing this?

Because I want you to know this isn't a quick cash-grab course. It's the resource I wish existed when I was learning.

150+ lessons. 3 platforms. Months of work.

Almost ready. Thank you for your patience.

#CourseCreation #DesignEngineering #OnlineEducation #BehindTheScenes
```

### LinkedIn 9 — The Value Proposition
```
What's your time worth?

I spent 10 years learning design engineering the hard way:
- Wrong tutorials
- Dead-end frameworks  
- Advice that sounded good but didn't work
- Skills I learned then had to unlearn

Conservative estimate: 2,000+ hours of inefficient learning.

The Design Engineer course is my attempt to compress that into ~100 hours of focused, intentional curriculum.

Not everything I know — but everything you need to know, in the order you need to know it.

Is it worth it? That depends on how you value your time.

Launching next week. Early access pricing available for the first cohort.

#DesignEngineering #Learning #CareerInvestment #TechEducation

## Email Sequences

### Email 1 — Welcome to the Waitlist
```
Subject: You're in. Here's what's coming.

Hey [NAME],

Thanks for joining the Design Engineer course waitlist. I'm genuinely excited you're here.

Quick background: I've spent 10+ years working at the intersection of design and engineering. The role that used to feel like an identity crisis is now one of the most in-demand positions in tech.

The problem? There's no clear path to becoming one.

Design schools don't teach code. Engineering programmes don't teach taste. And most online courses optimise for speed over depth.

So I'm building something different.

A comprehensive course covering:
- Design fundamentals (what engineers skip)
- Engineering fundamentals (what designers skip)  
- The convergence layer (what nobody teaches)

Across Web, iOS, and Android.

I'll be sharing more details over the coming weeks. For now, just know: this is the course I wish existed when I started.

Talk soon,
[YOUR NAME]

P.S. — Reply to this email and tell me: are you coming from design or engineering? I'm genuinely curious about who's on this list.
```

### Email 2 — The Problem I'm Solving
```
Subject: The £100k problem in tech hiring

Hey [NAME],

A recruiter friend told me something interesting last month.

Her clients are desperate for "Design Engineers" — people who can both design AND build. They're offering premium salaries. The roles stay open for months.

The problem? The talent doesn't exist.

Here's why:

Designers who "learn to code" usually stop at surface level. They can edit CSS but can't architect a component system.

Engineers who "learn design" usually develop opinions instead of taste. They know what they like but can't articulate principles.

The result: companies keep searching, and talented people keep feeling stuck in their lane.

The Design Engineer course is my attempt to fix this pipeline.

Not by teaching designers to code OR engineers to design — but by teaching both to think across disciplines simultaneously.

More details on the curriculum coming next week.

[YOUR NAME]

P.S. — If you've ever felt stuck on one side of the design/dev divide, I'd love to hear your story. Just reply to this email.
```

### Email 3 — The Curriculum Preview
```
Subject: What's actually in this course

Hey [NAME],

You asked (several of you, actually), so here's a proper curriculum breakdown:

**DESIGN TRACK**
- Visual design fundamentals (typography, colour theory, spacing)
- Platform-specific patterns (iOS HIG, Material Design, web conventions)
- Design systems and component architecture
- UX principles that actually improve products

**ENGINEERING TRACK**  
- Environment setup (the boring stuff tutorials skip)
- Language fundamentals with design context
- Component architecture and state management
- Platform APIs and implementation patterns

**CONVERGENCE TRACK**
- Accessibility as a first principle
- Performance as a design consideration
- The Design Engineer workflow
- Building a portfolio that demonstrates range
- Finding and landing DE roles

That's 150+ lessons across Web, iOS, and Android.

You don't have to complete everything. The tracks are designed so you can:
- Start with your weaker area
- Build towards the convergence layer
- Reference lessons as you need them in real work

This isn't "learn everything in 30 days." It's a comprehensive resource you'll return to throughout your career.

Launch date announcement coming soon.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Email 4 — My Story
```
Subject: Why I'm building this

Hey [NAME],

Let me tell you a quick story.

10 years ago, I was a designer who couldn't ship.

I'd create mockups. Hand them to developers. Watch them come back... different. "That's not technically possible" was my least favourite phrase.

So I learned to code.

First, it was frustrating. Then it was empowering. Then something unexpected happened:

I became a better designer.

Understanding constraints made my designs more elegant. Knowing what was hard made me creative about what was easy. The feedback loop between design and code made me faster at both.

This is what I now call Design Engineering.

It's not a job title. It's not a department. It's a way of thinking about building products.

And it's become the foundation of my career.

The course I'm building is everything I wish someone had taught me back then. The mental models. The practical skills. The integration layer that makes it all click.

More soon.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Email 5 — The Social Proof
```
Subject: What early reviewers are saying

Hey [NAME],

I've been quietly sharing draft lessons with a small group of designers and engineers.

Here's some of their feedback:

"Finally, someone explains WHY designers make certain choices, not just what tools they use." — Senior Engineer at [Company]

"The code sections assume I have taste. The design sections assume I'm not stupid. Refreshing." — Product Designer at [Company]

"I've taken 3 other courses. This is the first one that treats design and code as the same discipline." — Freelancer

I'm sharing this not to brag, but to show: this course is being built WITH input from people like you.

If you have thoughts on what you'd want to see covered, just reply. I'm still refining the final modules.

Launch is coming soon.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Email 6 — The Counter-Narrative
```
Subject: Why most courses fail

Hey [NAME],

Hot take: most "learn to code" courses make you a bad engineer.

They optimise for speed. "Build a Twitter clone in 4 hours!" Sounds great. Teaches you nothing about architecture, maintenance, or real-world constraints.

Most "learn design" courses have the same problem. "Create stunning visuals in Figma!" Great. But you've learned tools, not principles.

The Design Engineer course is different because:

1. It goes deep, not fast
2. It teaches principles before tools
3. It integrates design and code from day one

You won't finish it in a weekend. That's by design.

This is meant to be a reference you return to throughout your career — not a certificate you collect and forget.

More details on pricing and launch date coming next week.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Email 7 — The Urgency Setup
```
Subject: The timing is right

Hey [NAME],

Some data that might interest you:

- Design Engineer job postings have increased 400% in 3 years
- Average salaries for DE roles are 15-20% higher than pure design or engineering
- Companies like Vercel, Linear, and Figma are building entire teams around this hybrid role

The market is moving. Fast.

The question isn't whether Design Engineering is the future. It's whether you'll be ready when more companies realise it.

The course launches in 2 weeks. Early access pricing will be available for waitlist members.

I'll send details on pricing and bonuses in my next email.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Email 8 — Pricing Preview
```
Subject: Let's talk money

Hey [NAME],

The course launches in one week. Time to talk pricing.

Here's what I was thinking:

**Single Track** — £149
Access to one track (Design OR Engineering) for one platform (Web, iOS, or Android).

**Full Platform** — £249  
Access to both tracks plus Convergence for one platform.

**Convergence (Everything)** — £399
All tracks. All platforms. Lifetime access.

**Early Access Discount**
For waitlist members only: 25% off any tier for the first 48 hours.

That makes Convergence £299 during launch.

Is it cheap? No. But consider:
- 150+ lessons of original content
- 10 years of expertise compressed into structured curriculum
- Lifetime access (including future updates)
- No subscription. One payment. Forever.

If you spread Convergence over 12 months, it's less than £25/month. Less than most streaming subscriptions.

For something that could genuinely change your career trajectory.

Launch email comes next week.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Email 9 — 24 Hours Out
```
Subject: Tomorrow.

Hey [NAME],

This is it.

Tomorrow morning, the Design Engineer course goes live.

Quick recap of what you're getting:

✅ 150+ lessons across Design, Engineering, and Convergence
✅ Web, iOS, and Android tracks
✅ Lifetime access, including all future updates
✅ 25% early access discount (waitlist only, 48 hours)

I've been working on this for 6 months. It's the course I wish existed when I started my career.

I genuinely believe it can help you:
- Close the gap between design and development
- Build things you couldn't build before
- Position yourself for the hybrid roles companies are desperately hiring for

Tomorrow, 9am GMT.

See you then.

[YOUR NAME]

P.S. — Set a reminder. The early access discount is only available for 48 hours, and I won't be extending it.

## Cohort-Based vs Open Access Analysis

### Why Do Courses Use Cohorts?

**1. Community & Accountability**
- Cohorts create peer pressure and social motivation
- Students have classmates at the same stage
- Discussion forums are active because everyone's on the same material
- Built-in study groups and networking opportunities

**2. Live Interaction**
- Office hours, Q&A sessions, live workshops
- Real-time feedback from instructors
- Ability to adjust teaching based on common struggles
- Creates "event" energy around the course

**3. Scarcity & Urgency**
- "Enrolment closes Friday" drives action
- Limited seats justify premium pricing
- Creates FOMO for future cohorts
- Each cohort feels exclusive

**4. Structured Pacing**
- Students can't skip ahead or fall behind
- Everyone's discussing the same content
- Prevents the "I'll do it later" procrastination
- Creates natural deadlines

**5. Higher Completion Rates**
- Accountability to peers increases follow-through
- Scheduled sessions prevent abandonment
- Social proof of others progressing motivates continuation
- Typically 10-30% completion vs 3-5% for self-paced

**6. Premium Pricing Justification**
- Live elements justify £500-5000+ pricing
- "Access to instructor" is valuable positioning
- Community membership has ongoing value
- Feels more like education, less like content consumption

### Why Open Access Could Be Better for d×e

**1. Our Content Structure**
- 150+ lessons across multiple tracks is a lot to cohort
- Students have different starting points (designer vs engineer)
- Platform tracks (Web/iOS/Android) are independent paths
- Not everyone needs the same material

**2. Reference vs Course**
- This is designed as a career-long resource
- People will return to specific lessons during projects
- Cohort pacing doesn't fit "I need to learn X right now for work"
- Value comes from depth and completeness, not community

**3. Global Audience**
- Time zones make live sessions exclusionary
- Async-first is more accessible
- No "you missed the cohort" friction
- Always available when someone's ready to learn

**4. Our Business Model**
- One-time purchase is simpler than recurring cohorts
- No operational burden of running cohort cycles
- Content updates benefit all customers, not just current cohort
- Scales infinitely without additional effort

**5. The Hybrid Role Itself**
- Design Engineers are self-directed learners
- They figure things out independently — that's the job
- Heavy hand-holding may attract wrong audience
- Self-paced proves self-motivation

### Potential Hybrid Approach

If we wanted some cohort benefits without full cohort model:

**Option A: Cohort-Optional Community**
- Course is open access
- Optional paid Discord/Slack community
- Quarterly "learning sprints" for those who want accountability
- Live Q&As available to all, recorded for async

**Option B: Cohort Launches, Open Evergreen**
- Launch in cohorts (creates urgency and community)
- After cohort completes, course becomes evergreen
- Previous cohort members form ongoing community
- New evergreen purchasers can join community for extra fee

**Option C: Certification Cohorts**
- Course is open access for learning
- Optional cohort-based certification track
- Certification includes project review, live feedback
- Premium pricing for certification, not content

### Recommendation

**Start with open access.** Here's why:

1. **Lower operational burden** — Running cohorts is a job
2. **Matches content structure** — Multi-track, multi-platform doesn't fit cohort pacing
3. **Tests market first** — Prove demand before adding complexity
4. **Fits the audience** — DEs are self-starters by definition

**Add community later if there's demand:**
- Launch with optional Discord
- Monitor engagement and requests
- If people want accountability, offer it as add-on
- Don't force structure on people who don't need it

**Reserve cohorts for advanced offerings:**
- Future masterclasses or workshops
- Project-based intensive programmes
- 1:1 or small-group mentorship
- Career transition programmes

The core course should be accessible to anyone, anytime. That's the whole point of democratising this knowledge.

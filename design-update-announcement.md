**Subject:** We Rebuilt Everything (And Here's Why)

---

Hi there,

You might have noticed something different at d×e today.

We didn't just tweak the colors or move some buttons around. We rebuilt the entire platform from the ground up—stripping away everything that didn't serve the craft.

## Why Swiss? Why now?

Design engineering exists at the intersection. Not the average. Not the compromise. The *intersection*—where two disciplines meet and create something neither could achieve alone.

That's what the × symbol represents. Not multiplication. Not a close button. The precise point where design meets engineering.

Swiss design has always understood this kind of clarity. No decoration for decoration's sake. No rounded corners to soften the edges. Just pure form following function, with every pixel accountable to purpose.

When we looked at what we were building—a comprehensive course for design engineers—we realized the platform itself needed to embody those principles.

## What's Changed:

- **Pure Typography Hierarchy** — Host Grotesk for interface, Instrument Serif for content, JetBrains Mono for code. Each typeface earns its place.
- **Uncompromising Geometry** — Zero border-radius. Sharp edges. Honest containers that don't apologize for being rectangles.
- **Intentional Color** — Swiss red (#FF4400) as the only accent. Used sparingly. Used deliberately.
- **Functional Animation** — Motion that serves purpose, not decoration.

The result feels more like a workshop than a website. Which is exactly what a design engineering course should feel like.

## The Course (Coming Soon)

Speaking of the course: it's comprehensive in the way Swiss design is comprehensive. Not "more is more" but "everything necessary, nothing extraneous."

Three tracks:
1. **Design** — Visual fundamentals, typography, systems thinking
2. **Engineering** — HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web, Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android
3. **Convergence** — Where they meet: motion, prototyping, accessibility, the complete workflow

150+ lessons. Each one designed to build on the last. Free introduction modules so you can see if this is for you before committing.

We're not launching yet, but we wanted you to see the platform first. Explore it. Click around. Let the design communicate what design engineering is really about.

## Why This Matters

Most educational platforms try to feel friendly and approachable by softening every edge and warming every color. That's not what we're building.

We're building for people who care about craft. Who notice the 2px of spacing. Who understand that constraints breed creativity. Who know that the intersection of design and engineering isn't where you compromise—it's where you compound.

The platform you're seeing today is what you'll learn to build in the course.

Precision. Purpose. Craft.

More details coming soon. For now, we just wanted you to see it.

P.S. — If you spot anything that's not sharp enough, not clear enough, or not honest enough, let us know. We're holding ourselves to the same standard we're teaching.

# Building the Design Engineer Course

I've been building a course.

Not just any course. A proper curriculum for Design Engineers—the people who live at the intersection of design and code, who understand that the × symbol isn't decoration, it's the whole point.

## The problem with most courses

Most design or dev courses are either:

1. Too broad. "Learn everything!" they promise, then give you a scattered collection of tutorials with no structure.
2. Too narrow. Deep dives into one tool or framework, but no understanding of principles.
3. Too compromised. They try to make everyone happy and end up teaching to the average, not the intersection.

I've taken enough courses to know this. I've also taught enough to know that what people actually need is coherent thinking, not more tips and tricks.

## Why Swiss?

When we rebuilt the d×e platform, we stripped it down to pure Swiss design principles. No rounded corners. No unnecessary colour. Just Host Grotesk for interface, Instrument Serif for content, JetBrains Mono for code. Sharp edges. Honest geometry.

People asked: "Why so stark? Why so uncompromising?"

Because that's what design engineering is.

It's not about making everything feel friendly and approachable by softening the edges. It's about precision. It's about understanding that constraints breed creativity. It's about knowing that the intersection isn't where you compromise—it's where you compound.

The platform had to embody what we're teaching. If we're asking students to care about 2px of spacing, we better care about it too.

## What we're actually building

The course has three tracks:

**Design** — Not "10 Figma Tips." A complete foundation in visual thinking. Typography, colour systems, hierarchy, spatial relationships. Platform-specific patterns for iOS, Android, and web. How to think in systems, not just screens.

**Engineering** — Pick your platform: Web, iOS, or Android. Each track teaches you to build production-ready applications. Not toy examples. Real code that ships.

**Convergence** — This is where it gets interesting. Motion design. Prototyping workflows. Accessibility that actually works. The complete design engineering practice. And here's the thing: when you buy Convergence, you get everything. All tracks, all platforms, 156 lessons total.

We're not teaching shortcuts. We're teaching fundamentals that compound.

## Why I'm doing this

I learned design through code. Not because I had a teacher who understood both, but because I had to. I'd look at interfaces and try to reverse-engineer how they worked. I'd build prototypes to understand motion timing. I'd read HIG documentation like it was literature.

It was inefficient. But it worked because I approached development through a design lens—not as syntax to memorise, but as a system to understand.

Now there are better tools. Cursor. Claude. AI that can help you build faster. But here's what AI can't teach you: taste. Judgement. The ability to look at something and know why it works or why it doesn't.

That's what the course is for.

## The standard

Every lesson has been edited for clarity. Every code example is production-quality. Every exercise builds on what came before. The first section of each track is free—no credit card, no trial period that converts to paid. Just free.

Because if we're holding ourselves to a standard, you should be able to see it before committing.

We're launching properly soon. The platform is live. The curriculum is ready. The first cohort of students is already working through it.

This is what I wish existed when I was learning. A complete, uncompromising curriculum that doesn't treat design and engineering as separate disciplines to translate between, but as one practice to master.

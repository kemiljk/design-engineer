# Tools Launch Email

Hello again!

We've been busy. Really busy.

What started as a handful of utilities has grown into something much bigger: a complete toolkit for design engineers. **17 purpose-built tools** that eliminate the friction between idea and implementation.

No more hunting for formulas. No more context-switching between apps. No more "close enough" when you need precision.

Let's dive in.

## 🎬 Animation & Motion

### Spring Physics Playground

Drag sliders. Watch the ball bounce. Copy the code. That's it.

Whether you're targeting Motion, CSS, SwiftUI, or Android, this playground lets you experiment with mass, stiffness, and damping until the animation feels right. See it, tweak it, ship it.

### Easing Generator

For when springs are too much and linear is too little.

A visual cubic-bezier editor with draggable control points and real-time preview. Load presets or craft something entirely your own—the animation plays as you design it.

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Gradient Generator

Create stunning linear, radial, and conic gradients with full control over colour stops, angles, and positions.

Export to CSS, Tailwind, SwiftUI, or Android—all from one interface. The visual preview updates in real-time as you craft the perfect gradient.

### Shadow Generator

Design layered, realistic shadows that bring depth to your interfaces.

Fine-tune blur, spread, offset, and opacity across multiple shadow layers. Export to CSS, Tailwind, SwiftUI, Android, or React Native with one click.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/shadow-generator](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/shadow-generator)

### Colour Converter

Stop searching for colour conversion formulas.

Paste any colour in HEX, RGB, HSL, or OKLCH and instantly get values for every format you need—including SwiftUI and Android-specific colour formats. Copy and go.

### Border Comparison

Ever wondered why some cards look "off" on colourful backgrounds?

This tool reveals the difference between solid grey borders and semi-transparent black borders. Place identical cards on vibrant gradients and watch how a simple `rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` border adapts to any background—whilst grey stays stubbornly grey. Adjust border width, pick from the full Tailwind neutral palette, toggle shadows on and off, and switch between preset gradients or create your own. The side-by-side comparison makes the choice obvious.

### Blend Mode Explorer

Stop guessing how CSS blend modes work.

Learn what each blend mode actually does and experiment with stacking multiple layers to create beautiful visual effects. See the maths behind the magic, then apply it to your own designs with confidence.

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

Input width and height, get the ratio. Input width and ratio, get the height.

Simple, but essential. Includes common presets (16:9, 4:3, 1:1) and generates responsive CSS. The visual preview updates as you type.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/aspect-ratio](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/aspect-ratio)

### Corner Radius Calculator

Why do nested rounded corners sometimes look wrong?

Because inner and outer radii need to be mathematically related—not identical. This calculator uses Apple's containerRelative approach to compute harmonious inner radii based on padding and outer radius. Achieve optically perfect nested elements every time.

## 🧱 Design Systems

### Spectrum Generator

Generate a complete colour scale from a single colour.

Using perceptually uniform OKLCH, this tool creates harmonious tints and shades that maintain consistent visual steps across the entire spectrum. Perfect for building colour palettes that feel cohesive.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/tint-shade-generator](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/tint-shade-generator)

### Token Calculator

Start with a base size. Choose a scale ratio. Get a complete, harmonious type and spacing system.

Exports to Tailwind v4, CSS variables, or SCSS maps. No more arbitrary values—just mathematical consistency across your entire design system.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/token-calculator](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/token-calculator)

### Token Naming

Naming tokens is harder than it looks. This tool makes it systematic.

Build consistent, well-structured semantic token names using industry-standard conventions. Choose your naming pattern, then generate complete token sets with variants and states automatically applied. Never argue about naming conventions again.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/token-naming](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/token-naming)

## 📱 Mobile & Accessibility

### Touch Target Calculator

Are your tap targets accessible? Find out instantly.

Input your element dimensions and get pass/fail validation against iOS Human Interface Guidelines, Material Design specs, and WCAG accessibility standards—all at once.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/touch-target](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/touch-target)

### App Icon Sizes

Never hunt for icon dimensions again.

A complete reference guide for every app icon size you need—iOS, Android, macOS, and web. All the required dimensions, all in one place, always up to date.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/icon-generator](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/icon-generator)

---

## 🔧 Code & Development

### Framework Converter

Building in React but need Svelte? Working across multiple frameworks?

Paste your component code and convert syntax between React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, and Solid. It's not magic—it's pattern matching that saves you hours of manual translation.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/framework-converter](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/framework-converter)

## 🤖 AI-Powered

### Accessibility Auditor *(Requires Sign-in)*

Paste your React or HTML code. Get an instant AI-powered audit.

It checks semantic structure, ARIA attributes, contrast ratios, and more. But here's the key: it doesn't just flag issues—it explains why they matter and shows you how to fix them.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/accessibility-auditor](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/accessibility-auditor)

### Task Builder *(Requires Sign-in)*

Need practice? Generate customised design engineering challenges on demand.

Specify your skill level, focus areas, and constraints. The AI creates detailed task briefs—the kind you'd get in a real take-home assignment. Perfect for interview prep, portfolio building, or team training.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/task-builder](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/task-builder)

## The Philosophy

Every tool follows the same principle: **reduce the gap between thinking and making.**

✅ No account required for most tools

✅ No paywalls on the basics

✅ Export to web and native platforms

✅ Built for real workflows, not demos

The AI-powered tools (Accessibility Auditor and Task Builder) require a free account to help us manage API costs whilst keeping everything accessible.

## Content Guidelines

### Tone

- Conversational but professional
- Assume intelligence, explain concepts
- "We" language (learning together)
- Real-world examples over theoretical
- Link concepts back to the DE role

### Lesson Template

```markdown
# [Lesson Title]

> **Quick Summary:** One-line takeaway

## What You'll Learn

- Bullet points of outcomes

## [Main Content Sections]

Content with examples, code snippets, visuals

## Try It Yourself

Hands-on exercise

## Key Takeaways

- Summarize main points

## Next Steps

Link to next lesson or related content
```

### Code Examples

- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Show the "why" not just the "how"
- Provide working examples that can be copied
- Comments only for non-obvious things

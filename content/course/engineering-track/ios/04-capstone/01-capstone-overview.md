# Capstone Project: SwiftUI App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to build a complete, working SwiftUI app with custom components, proper state management, data persistence, and polished user experience.

## Why This Project?

A working SwiftUI app showcases the full breadth of iOS engineering skills:

- **Swift language proficiency** — Modern Swift patterns and syntax
- **SwiftUI view composition** — Declarative UI building
- **State management understanding** — Property wrappers and data flow
- **Data persistence skills** — SwiftData or UserDefaults
- **UI/UX implementation ability** — Polished, accessible interfaces

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Working SwiftUI App** — 3-5 fully functional screens with real data and persistence
2. **Custom Components** — Reusable view components and custom modifiers
3. **Proper Architecture** — Clean state management with Observable patterns
4. **Polish & Accessibility** — VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, refined interactions
5. **GitHub Repository** — Clean code organisation with comprehensive README

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Task Manager
A productivity app for managing tasks with lists, due dates, and priorities.

### Option B: Expense Tracker
A personal finance app for logging and categorising expenses.

### Option C: Notes App
A note-taking application with folders, search, and markdown support.

### Option D: Habit Tracker
An app for building habits with daily tracking and streak statistics.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Setup & Architecture](./02-capstone-setup.md) | Xcode project, data models, structure | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Core Screens](./03-capstone-screens.md) | List, detail, create, settings views | 3-4 hours |
| [3. Custom Components](./04-capstone-components.md) | Reusable views and modifiers | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Polish & Accessibility](./05-capstone-polish.md) | VoiceOver, animations, error handling | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Finalisation](./06-capstone-finalisation.md) | App icon, README, GitHub | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **SwiftUI Proficiency** | Basic views, some issues | Clean SwiftUI, proper patterns | Elegant, idiomatic SwiftUI throughout |
| **Code Organisation** | Code works, messy structure | Clean separation, good naming | Excellent architecture, reusable |
| **State Management** | State works, some prop drilling | Proper state patterns | Optimal state architecture |
| **UI Polish** | Basic UI, functional | Clean, consistent UI | Beautiful, delightful experience |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Labels present, decent support | Fully accessible, great VoiceOver |
| **Persistence** | Data saves but fragile | Reliable persistence | Robust, handles edge cases |

## Inspiration

Study these apps for different approaches:

**Task/Productivity:** Apple Reminders, Things 3

**Reference:** Apple's SwiftUI tutorials, Hacking with Swift examples, Stanford CS193p projects

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with data** — Model your data before UI
2. **Use previews** — SwiftUI previews speed up development
3. **Extract components** — When views get big, break them up
4. **Test on device** — Simulator misses performance issues
5. **Add accessibility early** — Harder to retrofit
6. **Commit often** — Small commits make debugging easier

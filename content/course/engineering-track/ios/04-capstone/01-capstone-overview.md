# Capstone Project: SwiftUI App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to build a complete, working SwiftUI app with custom components, proper state management, data persistence, and polished user experience.

## What You'll Learn

- How to build a complete working SwiftUI app
- Creating custom reusable components and modifiers
- Implementing proper state management architecture
- Adding data persistence to your app
- Achieving polish and accessibility in your UI

## Why This Project?

A working SwiftUI app showcases the full breadth of iOS engineering skills:

A working SwiftUI app provides a comprehensive demonstration of your iOS engineering skills, showcasing your proficiency in the modern Swift language and your ability to build declarative interfaces through effective view composition. You will demonstrate a solid understanding of state management and property wrappers, while also proving your ability to implement reliable data persistence and create polished, accessible user interfaces.

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you will have developed a working SwiftUI app featuring three to five fully functional screens with integrated persistence, supported by a library of custom reusable components and modifiers. The project will showcase a clean state management architecture based on observable patterns, all while maintaining a high level of polish and accessibility support. Finally, you will host your work in a well-organised GitHub repository complete with a comprehensive README.

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Task Manager
A productivity app for managing tasks with lists, due dates, and priorities.

### Option B: Expense Tracker
A personal finance app for logging and categorising expenses.

### Option C: Notes App
A note-taking application with folders, search, and markdown support.

### Option D: Habit Tracker
An app for building habits with daily tracking and streak statistics.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Setup & Architecture](./02-capstone-setup.md) | Xcode project, data models, structure | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Core Screens](./03-capstone-screens.md) | List, detail, create, settings views | 3-4 hours |
| [3. Custom Components](./04-capstone-components.md) | Reusable views and modifiers | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Polish & Accessibility](./05-capstone-polish.md) | VoiceOver, animations, error handling | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Finalisation](./06-capstone-finalisation.md) | App icon, README, GitHub | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **SwiftUI Proficiency** | Basic views, some issues | Clean SwiftUI, proper patterns | Elegant, idiomatic SwiftUI throughout |
| **Code Organisation** | Code works, messy structure | Clean separation, good naming | Excellent architecture, reusable |
| **State Management** | State works, some prop drilling | Proper state patterns | Optimal state architecture |
| **UI Polish** | Basic UI, functional | Clean, consistent UI | Beautiful, delightful experience |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Labels present, decent support | Fully accessible, great VoiceOver |
| **Persistence** | Data saves but fragile | Reliable persistence | Robust, handles edge cases |

## Inspiration

**Task/Productivity:** Apple Reminders, Things 3

**Reference:** Apple's SwiftUI tutorials, Hacking with Swift examples, Stanford CS193p projects

## Tips for Success

To ensure the success of your project, you should always begin by modelling your data before moving on to the user interface and make extensive use of SwiftUI previews to accelerate your development cycle. Extract components as soon as your views become too complex and remember to test your application on a physical device to catch performance issues that the simulator might miss. Address accessibility requirements as early as possible rather than retrofitting them later, and make frequent, small commits to your repository to simplify the debugging process.

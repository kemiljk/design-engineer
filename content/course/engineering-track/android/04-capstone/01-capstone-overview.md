# Capstone Project: Jetpack Compose App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to build a complete, working Android app with Jetpack Compose, custom composables, proper state management, data persistence, and polished user experience.

## Why This Project?

A working Compose app showcases the full breadth of Android engineering skills:

- **Kotlin language proficiency** — Modern Kotlin patterns and syntax
- **Jetpack Compose UI composition** — Declarative UI building
- **State management understanding** — ViewModel and StateFlow patterns
- **Data persistence skills** — Room or DataStore
- **UI/UX implementation ability** — Material 3, accessible interfaces

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Working Compose App** — 3-5 fully functional screens with real data and persistence
2. **Custom Composables** — Reusable UI components and custom modifiers
3. **Proper Architecture** — ViewModel state management with repository pattern
4. **Polish & Accessibility** — TalkBack support, Dynamic Type, Material motion
5. **GitHub Repository** — Clean code organisation with comprehensive README

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Task Manager
A productivity app for managing tasks with categories, due dates, and priorities.

### Option B: Expense Tracker
A personal finance app for logging and categorising expenses.

### Option C: Notes App
A note-taking application with folders, search, and markdown support.

### Option D: Habit Tracker
An app for building habits with daily tracking and streak statistics.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Setup & Architecture](./02-capstone-setup.md) | Android Studio project, data models, structure | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Core Screens](./03-capstone-screens.md) | List, detail, create, settings screens | 3-4 hours |
| [3. Custom Composables](./04-capstone-composables.md) | Reusable components and modifiers | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Polish & Accessibility](./05-capstone-polish.md) | TalkBack, animations, error handling | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Finalisation](./06-capstone-finalisation.md) | App icon, README, GitHub | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Compose Proficiency** | Basic composables, some issues | Clean Compose, proper patterns | Elegant, idiomatic Compose |
| **Code Organisation** | Code works, messy structure | Clean separation, good naming | Excellent architecture |
| **State Management** | State works, some issues | Proper ViewModel patterns | Optimal state architecture |
| **UI Polish** | Basic UI, functional | Clean Material 3 UI | Beautiful, delightful experience |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Semantics present | Fully accessible, great TalkBack |
| **Persistence** | Data saves but fragile | Reliable persistence | Robust, handles edge cases |

## Inspiration

Study these apps for different approaches:

**Task/Productivity:** Google Tasks, Todoist

**Reference:** Now in Android (Google), Jetpack Compose samples, Android Architecture Blueprints

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with data** — Model your data before UI
2. **Use previews** — Compose previews speed up development
3. **Extract composables** — When functions get big, break them up
4. **Test on device** — Emulator misses performance issues
5. **Add accessibility early** — Harder to retrofit
6. **Commit often** — Small commits make debugging easier

# Capstone Project: Jetpack Compose App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to build a complete, working Android app with Jetpack Compose, custom composables, proper state management, data persistence, and polished user experience.

## Why This Project?

A working Compose app showcases the full breadth of Android engineering skills:

A working Compose application allows you to showcase a full breadth of Android engineering skills. You will demonstrate high proficiency with modern Kotlin language patterns and syntax, alongside a deep understanding of Jetpack Compose UI composition for declarative building. This project also requires a strong grasp of state management using ViewModel and StateFlow patterns, data persistence techniques with Room or DataStore, and the ability to implement high-quality UI/UX through Material 3 and accessible interface design.

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Working Compose App** — A collection of 3-5 fully functional screens that interact with real data and persistent storage.
2. **Custom Composables** — A library of reusable UI components and bespoke modifiers tailored to your app's specific needs.
3. **Proper Architecture** — A robust implementation of ViewModel state management following the repository pattern for clean data flow.
4. **Polish & Accessibility** — A high level of refinement including full TalkBack support, Dynamic Type integration, and expressive Material motion.
5. **GitHub Repository** — A professionally organised codebase accompanied by a comprehensive README file to document your work.

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Task Manager
A productivity app for managing tasks with categories, due dates, and priorities.

### Option B: Expense Tracker
A personal finance app for logging and categorising expenses.

### Option C: Notes App
A note-taking application with folders, search, and markdown support.

### Option D: Habit Tracker
An app for building habits with daily tracking and streak statistics.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Setup & Architecture](./02-capstone-setup.md) | Android Studio project, data models, structure | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Core Screens](./03-capstone-screens.md) | List, detail, create, settings screens | 3-4 hours |
| [3. Custom Composables](./04-capstone-composables.md) | Reusable components and modifiers | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Polish & Accessibility](./05-capstone-polish.md) | TalkBack, animations, error handling | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Finalisation](./06-capstone-finalisation.md) | App icon, README, GitHub | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Compose Proficiency** | Basic composables, some issues | Clean Compose, proper patterns | Elegant, idiomatic Compose |
| **Code Organisation** | Code works, messy structure | Clean separation, good naming | Excellent architecture |
| **State Management** | State works, some issues | Proper ViewModel patterns | Optimal state architecture |
| **UI Polish** | Basic UI, functional | Clean Material 3 UI | Beautiful, delightful experience |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Semantics present | Fully accessible, great TalkBack |
| **Persistence** | Data saves but fragile | Reliable persistence | Robust, handles edge cases |

## Tips for Success

To ensure success, you should always model your data structures before attempting to build any UI components and rely on Compose previews to speed up your development cycle. Focus on extracting composables into smaller, manageable functions as they grow in complexity and always test your implementation on physical devices to catch performance issues that emulators might miss. Finally, remember to add accessibility features early in the process and commit your code frequently to make the debugging and version control experience as smooth as possible.

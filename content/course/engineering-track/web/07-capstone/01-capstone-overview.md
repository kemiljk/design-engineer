# Capstone Project: Component Library

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to build a production-ready component library with a token system, full accessibility, interactive documentation, and deployment to npm or a CDN.

## Why This Project?

Component libraries are exceptional portfolio pieces because they showcase the full breadth of frontend engineering skills, including deep HTML and CSS knowledge through the creation of semantic and accessible markup, JavaScript proficiency in building interactive behaviours, and strong systems thinking for consistent APIs and tokens. They also demonstrate your documentation skills and developer experience awareness, as well as DevOps knowledge regarding deployment and versioning.

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Token System** — CSS custom properties for colours, typography, spacing with light/dark theme support
2. **Component Library (8-10 components)** — Button, Input, Card, Badge, Alert, Modal, Tooltip, Dropdown, and more
3. **Interactive Documentation** — Live examples, props documentation, usage guidelines
4. **Deployment** — Published to npm, GitHub Packages, or CDN with versioned releases
5. **GitHub Repository** — Clean code organisation with comprehensive README

## Choose Your Theme

Select a design direction for your library:

### Option A: Minimal System
Clean, unopinionated components focused on accessibility and flexibility.

### Option B: Modern Professional
Contemporary, polished business aesthetic inspired by Stripe, Linear, Vercel.

### Option C: Playful/Creative
Friendly, approachable design with rounded corners and vibrant colours.

### Option D: Your Brand
Create something distinctive with your unique design direction.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into four focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Token System](./02-capstone-tokens.md) | Project setup, colour/typography/spacing tokens | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Core Components](./03-capstone-components.md) | Building 8-10 accessible components | 4-5 hours |
| [3. Documentation](./04-capstone-documentation.md) | Interactive docs site with examples | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Deployment](./05-capstone-deployment.md) | Build process, GitHub, publishing | 2-3 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Code Quality** | Works but inconsistent | Clean, consistent patterns | Exceptional organisation, DRY, maintainable |
| **Accessibility** | Some consideration | WCAG AA compliant | Exemplary a11y, thorough testing |
| **Documentation** | Basic docs exist | Clear, complete docs | Exceptional DX, live examples, thorough |
| **API Design** | Functional but awkward | Intuitive, consistent | Elegant, flexible, well-considered |
| **Visual Polish** | Basic styling | Clean, professional | Beautiful, cohesive, delightful |
| **Token System** | Tokens exist | Well-organised, useful | Elegant architecture, fully themeable |

## Inspiration

Study these component libraries:

**Minimal/Headless:** Radix UI, Headless UI, Reach UI

**Styled:** Chakra UI, Mantine, daisyUI

**Enterprise:** Carbon Design System, Atlassian Design System, Polaris

## Tips for Success

To ensure your project is successful, it is recommended to start by building your tokens, as a solid foundation will make developing individual components much easier. You should also build accessibility into your components from the start rather than attempting to add it later, and document your progress as you build to avoid a large tasks at the end. Always test your components in context to ensure they work well together, keep your scope realistic by focusing on 8–10 polished components rather than 20 rough ones, and use real content instead of placeholder text to help uncover potential layout issues.

# Capstone Project: Component Library

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to build a production-ready component library with a token system, full accessibility, interactive documentation, and deployment to npm or a CDN.

## Why This Project?

Component libraries are exceptional portfolio pieces because they showcase the full breadth of frontend engineering skills:

- **Deep HTML/CSS knowledge** — Semantic, accessible markup
- **JavaScript proficiency** — Interactive behaviours
- **Systems thinking** — Consistent APIs, tokens
- **Documentation skills** — Developer experience
- **DevOps awareness** — Deployment, versioning

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Token System** — CSS custom properties for colours, typography, spacing with light/dark theme support
2. **Component Library (8-10 components)** — Button, Input, Card, Badge, Alert, Modal, Tooltip, Dropdown, and more
3. **Interactive Documentation** — Live examples, props documentation, usage guidelines
4. **Deployment** — Published to npm, GitHub Packages, or CDN with versioned releases
5. **GitHub Repository** — Clean code organisation with comprehensive README

## Choose Your Theme

Select a design direction for your library:

### Option A: Minimal System
Clean, unopinionated components focused on accessibility and flexibility.

### Option B: Modern Professional
Contemporary, polished business aesthetic inspired by Stripe, Linear, Vercel.

### Option C: Playful/Creative
Friendly, approachable design with rounded corners and vibrant colours.

### Option D: Your Brand
Create something distinctive with your unique design direction.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into four focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Token System](./02-capstone-tokens.md) | Project setup, colour/typography/spacing tokens | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Core Components](./03-capstone-components.md) | Building 8-10 accessible components | 4-5 hours |
| [3. Documentation](./04-capstone-documentation.md) | Interactive docs site with examples | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Deployment](./05-capstone-deployment.md) | Build process, GitHub, publishing | 2-3 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Code Quality** | Works but inconsistent | Clean, consistent patterns | Exceptional organisation, DRY, maintainable |
| **Accessibility** | Some consideration | WCAG AA compliant | Exemplary a11y, thorough testing |
| **Documentation** | Basic docs exist | Clear, complete docs | Exceptional DX, live examples, thorough |
| **API Design** | Functional but awkward | Intuitive, consistent | Elegant, flexible, well-considered |
| **Visual Polish** | Basic styling | Clean, professional | Beautiful, cohesive, delightful |
| **Token System** | Tokens exist | Well-organised, useful | Elegant architecture, fully themeable |

## Inspiration

Study these component libraries:

**Minimal/Headless:** Radix UI, Headless UI, Reach UI

**Styled:** Chakra UI, Mantine, daisyUI

**Enterprise:** Carbon Design System, Atlassian Design System, Polaris

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with tokens** — A solid foundation makes components easier
2. **Build accessibility in** — Don't bolt it on after
3. **Document as you build** — Don't leave it all for the end
4. **Test in context** — Components should work together
5. **Keep scope realistic** — 8-10 polished components > 20 rough ones
6. **Use real content** — "Lorem ipsum" hides layout issues

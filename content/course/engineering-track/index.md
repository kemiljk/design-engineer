# Engineering Track

Build the skills to implement any design. This track covers the technical foundations you need to bring designs to life across web and mobile platforms.

## What You'll Learn

During this track, you will master the web fundamentals of semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, while simultaneously developing your mobile expertise with Swift and SwiftUI for iOS, alongside Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android. We'll examine robust component architectures for building reusable and accessible UI elements, and explore the implementation of design systems in code through tokens and component APIs. Finally, you will establish a high standard of best practices for performance, accessibility, and long-term maintainability in all your engineering projects.

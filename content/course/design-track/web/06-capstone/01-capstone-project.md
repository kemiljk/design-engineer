# Capstone Project: Design a Product Landing Page

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to design a complete, portfolio-worthy product landing page with a mini design system, responsive layouts, and interactive prototype.

## What You'll Learn

- How to synthesize all design skills into a cohesive project
- Creating a mini design system from scratch
- Designing responsive layouts for real-world use
- Building interactive prototypes that tell a story
- Documenting your process for portfolio presentation

## Project Overview

This capstone brings together everything from the Design Track: visual design fundamentals, typography, colour, spacing, design tools, systems thinking, and UX principles. You'll design a complete product landing page that demonstrates professional-level work.

**Why this project?** Landing pages are essential portfolio pieces. They showcase:
- Visual design skills (typography, colour, composition)
- Systematic thinking (tokens, components)
- Responsive design (desktop to mobile)
- Interaction design (prototype behaviours)
- Communication skills (selling a product visually)

**Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Complete Landing Page Design**
   - Desktop layout (1440px or 1920px)
   - Tablet layout (768px)
   - Mobile layout (375px)

2. **Mini Design System**
   - Colour tokens (primary, secondary, neutral, semantic)
   - Typography scale (6-8 styles)
   - Spacing scale (4-8 values)
   - Component library (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)

3. **Interactive Prototype**
   - Hero interactions
   - Navigation behaviour
   - Key user flows
   - Scroll-based transitions (optional)

4. **Case Study Documentation**
   - Project brief and goals
   - Design decisions and rationale
   - Process documentation
   - Final deliverables

- **Challenge:** Balance information density with visual appeal

### Option B: Consumer App
Design a landing page for a mobile-first consumer product:
- **Suggestions:** Fitness app, finance app, meditation app, social app
- **Sections:** Hero with app preview, key features, app store badges, social proof

## Phase 1: Foundation & Tokens (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Research & Moodboard
Before designing, gather inspiration:
- Find 5-10 landing pages in your chosen category
- Screenshot specific elements you admire
- Note patterns: layouts, typography choices, colour usage
- Create a moodboard in Figma

### Step 2: Define Your Brand
Establish the personality:
- **Product name** (fictional is fine)
- **Value proposition** (one sentence)
- **Target audience** (be specific)
- **Brand attributes** (3-5 adjectives)
- **Tone of voice** (formal, playful, technical, etc.)

### Step 3: Create Design Tokens

**Colour System:**
```
Primary: [Your main brand color + 2-3 shades]
Secondary: [Complementary accent color]
Neutral: [Grey scale, 5-7 values]
Semantic: [Success, warning, error, info]
```

**Typography Scale:**
```
Display: [For hero headlines]
H1-H4: [Section and content headers]
Body Large: [Intro text]
Body: [Main content]
Small: [Captions, labels]
```

**Spacing Scale:**
```
4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px
```

### Checkpoint
✓ Moodboard created with clear inspiration
✓ Brand identity defined
✓ Colour tokens documented in Figma
✓ Typography scale established
✓ Spacing scale defined

## Phase 2: Layout & Wireframes (1-2 hours)

### Step 1: Content Strategy
Plan your page structure:
- List all sections needed
- Define content hierarchy
- Write placeholder copy (or real copy)
- Identify where imagery is needed

### Step 2: Desktop Wireframes
Create low-fidelity layouts:
- Focus on structure, not visuals
- Use boxes and lines
- Establish rhythm and spacing
- Plan for content of varying lengths

### Step 3: Responsive Strategy
Plan how each section adapts:
- What stacks vs. what reflows?
- How does navigation change?
- Where do breakpoints occur?
- What content changes per viewport?

### Checkpoint
✓ Page sections defined and prioritised
✓ Desktop wireframe complete
✓ Responsive strategy documented
✓ Content placeholders in place

## Phase 3: Visual Design (3-4 hours)

### Step 1: Hero Section
The hero sets the tone:
- Apply your typography scale
- Integrate brand colours
- Design the primary CTA
- Add hero imagery/illustration
- Make it scannable in 3 seconds

### Step 2: Component Library
Build reusable components:
- **Buttons:** Primary, secondary, ghost (all states)
- **Cards:** Feature cards, testimonial cards
- **Inputs:** Form fields with states
- **Navigation:** Header, mobile menu
- **Footer:** Links, social icons

### Step 3: Full Page Design
Bring it all together:
- Design remaining sections
- Maintain visual consistency
- Apply appropriate spacing
- Check alignment and rhythm
- Ensure visual hierarchy is clear

### Step 4: Responsive Designs
Adapt for all viewports:

### Step 1: Design Review
Audit your work:
- Consistent spacing throughout?
- Typography hierarchy clear?
- Colour usage intentional?
- Alignment precise?
- Edge cases considered?

### Step 2: Micro-interactions
Add detail to key moments:
- Button hover states
- Card hover effects
- Input focus states
- Navigation transitions

### Step 3: Prototype
Connect the experience:
- Link navigation elements
- Add scroll behaviours (optional)
- Create any modal flows
- Test the prototype end-to-end

### Step 4: Final Polish
The details that matter:
- Check text alignment
- Verify colour contrast
- Ensure consistent corner radii
- Review shadow usage
- Pixel-perfect alignment

### Checkpoint

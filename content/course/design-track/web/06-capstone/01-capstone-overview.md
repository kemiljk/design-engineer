# Capstone Project: Product Landing Page

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to design a complete, portfolio-worthy product landing page. This overview explains what you'll create and how to choose your product.

## Why This Project?

Landing pages are exceptional portfolio pieces because they showcase the full breadth of design skills:

Landing pages are exceptional portfolio pieces because they showcase a full breadth of design skills, from visual execution in typography, colour, and composition to systematic thinking through tokens and components. They also require demonstrating a mastery of responsive design for mobile adaptation, interaction design for prototyping behaviours, and the effective communication needed to sell a product visually.

**Total Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

By the end of this capstone, you will have developed a complete landing page design with responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile, alongside a mini design system based on colour, typography, and spacing scales. You will also create an interactive prototype that demonstrates hero interactions and key user flows, supported by comprehensive case study documentation that outlines your process and rationale.

## Choose Your Product

Select one of these product types, or propose your own:

### Option A: SaaS Product
Designing a landing page for a B2B SaaS product challenges you to balance information density (such as pricing tables and features grids) with visual appeal, using suggestions like project management or developer tools.

### Option B: Consumer App
A consumer app project focuses on creating excitement for mobile-first products like fitness or finance apps, requiring sections for app previews and store badges while clearly explaining the product's value.

### Option C: Physical Product
Choosing a physical product allows you to make tangible goods (like smart devices or sustainable products) feel real on a screen, using hero imagery and reviews to illustrate features and benefits.

### Option D: Creative Service
Design for a creative service agency or freelancer to let the work speak for itself through portfolio showcases, maintaining clear UX while highlighting services and team background.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into four focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Foundation & Tokens](./02-capstone-foundation.md) | Research, brand definition, design tokens | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Layout & Wireframes](./03-capstone-layout.md) | Content strategy, wireframes, responsive planning | 1-2 hours |
| [3. Visual Design](./04-capstone-visual-design.md) | Hero, components, full page, responsive designs | 3-4 hours |
| [4. Polish & Documentation](./05-capstone-polish.md) | Refinement, prototype, case study | 2-3 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project. Be honest with yourself—the goal is growth, not perfection:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Visual Design** | Basic aesthetics, inconsistent application | Solid visual hierarchy, good typography | Exceptional polish, refined details, cohesive aesthetic |
| **Systematic Thinking** | Tokens exist but inconsistent | Well-organised system, consistently applied | Elegant system architecture, thoughtful naming, extensible |
| **Attention to Detail** | Some alignment issues, missing states | Clean alignment, most states covered | Pixel-perfect, all edge cases considered |
| **Responsive Design** | Basic adaptation, some issues | Thoughtful breakpoints, good adaptation | Seamless experience across all viewports |
| **Interaction Design** | Basic hover states | Clear interaction patterns | Delightful micro-interactions, fluid prototype |
| **Communication** | Design exists but rationale unclear | Process documented, decisions explained | Compelling story, clear thinking, portfolio-ready |

## Inspiration

Study these landing pages for different approaches:

**SaaS:** Linear, Notion, Vercel — Clean, systematic, sophisticated

**Consumer:** Headspace, Robinhood, Oura — Warm, bold, premium

**DTC Product:** Apple AirPods, Allbirds, Dyson — Premium, focused, precise

**Creative:** Basic Agency, Pentagram, Anagrama — Bold typography, work-focused, elegant

## Tips for Success

Success in this project starts with using real copy to drive better layout decisions and adopting a mobile-first approach to force clarity and prioritisation. Ensure you use real imagery from sources like Unsplash to avoid a placeholder aesthetic, get early feedback on wireframes before polishing, and document your process with screenshots to save time during final documentation.

## Get Started

Before moving to Phase 1:

Before moving to Phase 1, ensure you have chosen your product type, researched several category-specific landing pages for inspiration, and created a new Figma file for your capstone project work.

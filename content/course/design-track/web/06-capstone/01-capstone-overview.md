## The Phases

This capstone is broken into four focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Foundation & Tokens](./02-capstone-foundation.md) | Research, brand definition, design tokens | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Layout & Wireframes](./03-capstone-layout.md) | Content strategy, wireframes, responsive planning | 1-2 hours |
| [3. Visual Design](./04-capstone-visual-design.md) | Hero, components, full page, responsive designs | 3-4 hours |
| [4. Polish & Documentation](./05-capstone-polish.md) | Refinement, prototype, case study | 2-3 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project. Be honest with yourself—the goal is growth, not perfection:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Visual Design** | Basic aesthetics, inconsistent application | Solid visual hierarchy, good typography | Exceptional polish, refined details, cohesive aesthetic |
| **Systematic Thinking** | Tokens exist but inconsistent | Well-organised system, consistently applied | Elegant system architecture, thoughtful naming, extensible |
| **Attention to Detail** | Some alignment issues, missing states | Clean alignment, most states covered | Pixel-perfect, all edge cases considered |
| **Responsive Design** | Basic adaptation, some issues | Thoughtful breakpoints, good adaptation | Seamless experience across all viewports |
| **Interaction Design** | Basic hover states | Clear interaction patterns | Delightful micro-interactions, fluid prototype |
| **Communication** | Design exists but rationale unclear | Process documented, decisions explained | Compelling story, clear thinking, portfolio-ready |

## Inspiration

Study these landing pages for different approaches:

**SaaS:** Linear, Notion, Vercel — Clean, systematic, sophisticated

**Consumer:** Headspace, Robinhood, Oura — Warm, bold, premium

**DTC Product:** Apple AirPods, Allbirds, Dyson — Premium, focused, precise

**Creative:** Basic Agency, Pentagram, Anagrama — Bold typography, work-focused, elegant

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with content** — Real or realistic copy makes better designs
2. **Design mobile first** — It forces clarity and prioritisation
3. **Use real imagery** — Unsplash helps avoid placeholder-itis
4. **Get feedback early** — Share wireframes before investing in polish
5. **Don't over-design** — Know when to stop adding and start refining
6. **Document as you go** — Taking screenshots during process saves time later

## Get Started

1. **Choose your product type** from Options A-D (or propose your own)
2. **Research 5-10 landing pages** in your chosen category
3. **Create a new Figma file** for your capstone project

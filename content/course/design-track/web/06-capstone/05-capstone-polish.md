# Capstone: Polish and Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Add the finishing touches that elevate your work from good to great, create an interactive prototype, and document your process for your portfolio.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- How to audit and polish your designs
- Adding micro-interactions and prototyping
- Documenting your process professionally
- Preparing work for your portfolio

## Step 1: Design Review

Audit your work systematically:

### Spacing Audit

- [ ] Consistent vertical rhythm between sections
- [ ] Consistent horizontal padding
- [ ] Component internal spacing matches your scale
- [ ] Related elements grouped with proximity
- [ ] Adequate breathing room around key elements

### Typography Audit

- [ ] All text uses defined styles
- [ ] Hierarchy is clear at a glance
- [ ] Line lengths are readable (50-75 characters)
- [ ] Line heights are appropriate
- [ ] No orphaned words at line ends (in headlines)

### Colour Audit

- [ ] Colour usage is purposeful, not decorative
- [ ] Sufficient contrast for accessibility (4.5:1 for text)
- [ ] Consistent use of semantic colours
- [ ] Not too many colours competing

### Alignment Audit

- [ ] Elements align to a clear grid
- [ ] Text alignment is consistent
- [ ] Images and illustrations align with content
- [ ] No "almost aligned" elements (fully align or clearly offset)

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Long content handled gracefully
- [ ] Short content doesn't break layout
- [ ] Empty states considered (where relevant)
- [ ] Error states designed (forms)

## Step 2: Micro-interactions

Add detail to key moments:

### Button States

Ensure you've designed:
- Default → Hover (subtle colour shift, shadow)
- Hover → Active (pressed feel)
- Focus (keyboard users need visible focus)

### Card Interactions

- Hover lift (translateY + shadow increase)
- Image zoom (if applicable, with overflow: hidden)
- Subtle colour shifts

### Navigation

- Link hover states
- Active page indicator
- Mobile menu open/close transition
- Dropdown animations

### Forms

- Input focus glow
- Validation feedback
- Success/error states
- Button loading state

## Step 3: Prototype

Connect your designs into an interactive experience:

### Essential Connections

At minimum, prototype:
- [ ] Navigation links work
- [ ] CTAs show interaction (scroll to section or modal)
- [ ] Mobile menu opens/closes

### Optional Enhancements

If time permits:
- [ ] Scroll-based reveals
- [ ] Hover interactions on components
- [ ] Form validation flows
- [ ] Modal/overlay interactions

### Testing Your Prototype

- Click through as a user would
- Check all links and buttons
- Test on actual devices if possible
- Note any jarring transitions

## Step 4: Organise Your File

Structure for presentation:

### Recommended Page Structure

```text
📁 Your Capstone File
├── 🎨 Cover
├── 📚 Design System
│   ├── Colours
│   ├── Typography
│   ├── Spacing & Sizing
│   └── Components
├── 🖥 Desktop
│   └── Full page design
├── 📱 Tablet
│   └── 768px adaptation
├── 📱 Mobile
│   └── 375px adaptation
├── 🔗 Prototype Flows
│   └── Annotated interactions
└── 📝 Process
    ├── Moodboard
    └── Wireframes
```

### Naming Conventions

- Use clear, consistent names
- Number pages for order (01 Cover, 02 Design System...)
- Name components descriptively (Button/Primary/Default)

## Step 5: Write Your Case Study

Document your journey:

### Case Study Template

**1. Challenge**
- What was the brief?
- What problem were you solving?
- Who is the target audience?

**2. Process**
- How did you approach research?
- What informed your design decisions?
- What iterations did you go through?

**3. Key Decisions**
- Why did you choose these colours/fonts?
- What design principles guided you?
- What tradeoffs did you make?

**4. Results**
- Show the final designs
- Highlight key features
- Show responsive adaptations

**5. Learnings**
- What went well?
- What would you do differently?
- What did you learn?

### Case Study Tips

- **Show your thinking, not just the output**
- Include before/after or iteration comparisons
- Use annotations to explain decisions
- Keep it scannable (headers, bullets, visuals)

## Step 6: Prepare for Portfolio

Make it portfolio-ready:

### Export Key Screens

- Desktop hero and full page
- Mobile full page
- Key component states
- Prototype GIF or video

### Create Mockups

- Use device frames (Figma has plugins)
- Show designs in context
- Create browser mockups for desktop
- Create phone mockups for mobile

### Write Project Description

For your portfolio page:

> **[Product Name] Landing Page**
> 
> A landing page design for [product type], featuring a custom design system, responsive layouts, and interactive prototype.
> 
> **Skills demonstrated:**
> - Visual design
> - Design systems
> - Responsive design
> - Prototyping

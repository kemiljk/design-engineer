# Capstone: Polish and Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Add the finishing touches that elevate your work from good to great, create an interactive prototype, and document your process for your portfolio.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- How to audit and polish designs for maximum impact
- Adding sophisticated micro-interactions and prototyping
- Documenting your process professionally
- Preparing final work for high-quality portfolio presentation

## Step 1: The Design Audit

Great design is often about what you remove, not what you add. Before you call this project "done," you need to look at it with fresh eyes—ideally after a good night's sleep.

### The Squint Test
Zoom out until your design is the size of a postage stamp, or squint your eyes until everything blurs. What stands out? It should be your primary Call to Action (CTA) and your main headline. If the secondary button is fighting for attention, or if the navigation bar is too heavy, fix the hierarchy.

### The Rhythm Check
Look at the spacing between your sections. Is it consistent? If you used 80px padding for the Hero section, did you use 60px for the Features section? Inconsistent spacing makes a design feel "off" even if users can't articulate why. Regularize your vertical rhythm.

### The Alignment Audit
In digital design, "almost aligned" is worse than "misaligned." Check every text block, button, and image. Are they snapping to your grid? If an image is 1px off, it creates visual tension. Be ruthless.

## Step 2: Micro-interactions

Motion is the body language of your interface. It tells users how to feel about their interactions.

**Button States:**
Don't just change the color on hover. Consider a subtle lift (shadow increase) or a scale effect. Ensure the "Active" (pressed) state feels tactile, like a physical switch being thrown.

**Focus States:**
For keyboard users, the focus ring is their cursor. Make sure every interactive element has a visible, clear focus state. This isn't just polish; it's accessibility.

Any clickable card should convey its interactivity through a subtle lift on hover, achieved by combining a slight vertical translation with an increase in shadow depth to create a convincing three-dimensional effect.

## Step 3: Prototyping

A prototype is worth a thousand meetings. Static screens leave too much to the imagination.

**Tell a Story:**
Don't just link every button to every page. prototype a specific "Happy Path." Imagine a user who wants to sign up. Connect the "Get Started" button to the Signup form. Connect the "Submit" button to a Success message. This narrative approach makes your prototype demoworthy.

Enhance your prototype's narrative by moving beyond default transitions, using "Smart Animate" for fluid state changes like toggles, while reserving push or slide effects for page navigation and overlays for modals and dropdown menus.

## Step 4: File Organization

A messy design file is a red flag to potential employers. Treat your Figma file as a deliverable in itself.

**Structure:**
Create a dedicated "Cover" page with a thumbnail that looks good in the file browser. Separate your "Playground" (messy explorations) from your "Final Designs" (clean, approved work).

Success requires a disciplined approach to file naming; rename every layer so that a description like "Hero Section" replaces generic internal tags, and group related elements logically to reflect an understanding of technical structure.

## Step 5: The Case Study

Your portfolio needs to explain *why* you made these decisions, not just show the final result.

**The Challenge:** Start with the brief. Who is this for? What problem does it solve? "I wanted to design a landing page for a dog walking service that feels trustworthy and local."

**The Process:** Show your messy work. Show the sketches. Show the wireframes. Show the version where you used blue instead of green and explain why you changed it. Design managers want to see your thinking, not just your Dribbble shot.

**The Solution:** Present the final polished UI. Show the desktop view and the mobile view side-by-side to demonstrate your responsiveness skills.

## Step 6: Portfolio Prep

**Mockups:**
Don't just paste flat JPEGs. Put your design inside a device frame (like a MacBook or iPhone). This provides context and scale. Use a plugin like "Mockup" in Figma to warp your screen into a realistic 3D device.

**Video:**
Record a quick Loom or screen capture of you clicking through the prototype. Seeing the hover states and transitions in action makes the design feel real.

## Submission Checklist

Before submitting your final project, ensure that your design system is fully tokenised for colours, typography, and spacing, and that you have established responsive views for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Verify that your prototype includes a working flow from the hero section to signup and that your entire Figma file is organised and clearly labelled.

## What's Next

Congratulations on completing the Design Track capstone! You have taken a concept from a blank canvas to a polished, interactive, responsive reality.

This project is now a cornerstone of your portfolio. It demonstrates not just that you can make things look pretty, but that you can build systems, think about users, and execute with precision.

Continue your journey by heading to the Engineering Track to build your design in code, exploring the Convergence Track for advanced motion and polish, or applying your skills to mobile in the iOS Design Track.

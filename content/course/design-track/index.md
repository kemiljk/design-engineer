# Design Track

Learn to think like a designer. This track covers the principles, patterns, and practices that define great digital product design across all platforms. You will move beyond "making things pretty" to understanding the systems and logic that drive modern interfaces.

## What You'll Learn

By progressing through this track, you will master visual design fundamentals—including typography, colour theory, and layout—to create clear hierarchy. You will gain a deep understanding of platform-specific guidelines like Apple's HIG and Google's Material Design 3, while learning to build robust design systems with tokens and clear documentation. Furthermore, you will apply user-centred UX principles to solve complex problems through interaction design and bridge the gap between Figma and production code in SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

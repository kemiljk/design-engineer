# Capstone: Phone Screen Design

> **Quick Summary:** Plan your information architecture and design core phone screens using Material 3 components.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Planning information architecture
- Choosing Material 3 navigation patterns
- Designing core screens
- Applying Material 3 components correctly

## Step 1: Information Architecture

Plan your app structure:
- What are the main destinations?
- How does navigation flow?
- Where are the primary actions (FAB placement)?
- What content needs containment (cards, sheets)?

## Step 2: Navigation Pattern

Choose Material 3 navigation:
- **Navigation Bar:** For 3-5 main destinations
- **Navigation Drawer:** For 5+ destinations or secondary nav
- **Top App Bar:** For hierarchy and actions
- **Navigation Rail:** For tablets (plan ahead)

## Step 3: Core Screens

Design your main screens:

**For each screen, design:**
- Purpose and user goal
- Key content and components
- FAB or primary action placement
- Navigation elements

**Required screens:**
1. **Home/Dashboard:** Primary app view
2. **List/Feed View:** Multiple items display
3. **Detail View:** Single item focus
4. **Create/Edit:** Content creation (if applicable)
5. **Settings:** App configuration

## Step 4: Material Component Usage

Apply Material 3 components correctly:
- **FABs:** For primary creation actions
- **Cards:** For contained content groups
- **Lists:** For scannable content
- **Dialogs:** For decisions/confirmations
- **Bottom Sheets:** For additional options
- **Chips:** For filters and selections
- **Text Fields:** For input (outlined or filled)

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] Information architecture mapped
- [ ] Navigation pattern chosen
- [ ] 5-7 phone screens designed
- [ ] Material 3 components used correctly
- [ ] Consistent spacing and elevation

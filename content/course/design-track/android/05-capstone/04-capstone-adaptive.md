# Capstone: Adaptive Layouts

> **Quick Summary:** Plan breakpoints and design tablet layouts with navigation rail and content adaptation.

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Planning responsive breakpoints
- Adapting navigation for larger screens
- Designing content transformations
- Creating tablet-specific layouts

## Step 1: Breakpoint Strategy

Plan your responsive behaviour:
- **Compact:** < 600dp (phones)
- **Medium:** 600-840dp (tablets portrait, foldables)
- **Expanded:** > 840dp (tablets landscape, desktop)

## Step 2: Navigation Adaptation

Plan how navigation transforms:
- **Compact:** Bottom navigation bar
- **Medium:** Navigation rail (side)
- **Expanded:** Navigation rail with labels or drawer

## Step 3: Content Adaptation

Design layout transformations:
- **List-Detail:** Side-by-side on large screens
- **Grid Layouts:** More columns on larger screens
- **Reading Width:** Constrain content for readability
- **Supporting Panel:** Secondary content alongside primary

## Step 4: Tablet/Large Screen Design

Create expanded layout:
- At least one key flow at tablet size
- Navigation rail implementation
- Two-pane layout (if applicable)
- Proper use of space (not just stretched phone)

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] Breakpoints defined
- [ ] Navigation adaptation planned
- [ ] At least one tablet layout complete
- [ ] Content reflows appropriately

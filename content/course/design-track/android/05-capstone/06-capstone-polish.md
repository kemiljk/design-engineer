# Capstone: Polish & Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Finish the job. Design your adaptive icon, conduct a design audit, and package your work for your portfolio.

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Designing a multilayered adaptive icon
- Conducting a thorough design audit
- Writing a compelling case study
- Organising files for professional portfolio presentation

## Step 1: Adaptive Icon

Android icons are multilayered.
To create a proper adaptive icon, you must design separate foreground and background layers and test how they appear when masked into different shapes like circles or squircles. You should also produce a monochrome version for Android's themed icon feature, allowing your brand to adapt seamlessly to the user's chosen wallpaper colour.

## Step 2: Design Audit

Be your own critic.
Review your technical execution by ensuring every colour is mapped to a token rather than a hard-coded hex value and that your type hierarchy strictly follows the official Material scale. You should also verify that all spacing adheres to the 4dp grid and that every text element meets the 4.5:1 contrast ratio required for accessibility.

## Step 3: Case Study

Tell the story.
Tell your story by documenting the core problem your app solves and showcasing your colour palette and type scale. Provide side-by-side comparisons of phone and tablet views to prove your adaptive design skills and embed a GIF to demonstrate your prototype's motion characteristics.

## Step 4: File Organisation

Clean up.
Prepare your deliverables by creating a high-quality thumbnail cover and separating your explorations from the final assets. Finally, export all core screens as high-resolution PNGs to ensure your portfolio looks sharp across all viewing platforms.

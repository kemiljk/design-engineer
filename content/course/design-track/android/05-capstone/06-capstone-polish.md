# Capstone: Polish & Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Finish the job. Design your adaptive icon, conduct a design audit, and package your work for your portfolio.

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Designing an adaptive icon
- Conducting a thorough design audit
- Writing a case study
- Organising files for portfolio

## Step 1: Adaptive Icon

Android icons are multilayered.
- **Layers:** Design a Foreground (Icon) and a Background (Solid/Pattern).
- **Masks:** Test how it looks masked as a Circle, a Square, and a Squircle.
- **Monochrome:** Create a single-colour version of your icon. This is used for the "Themed Icon" feature in Android 13+, where the icon takes on the user's wallpaper colour.

## Step 2: Design Audit

Be your own critic.
- **Token Usage:** Did you cheat and use a hard-coded hex value? Fix it.
- **Type Scale:** Are you using `Headline Medium` or did you manually set `32px`?
- **Alignment:** Check your 4dp and 8dp spacing. Turn on the pixel grid.
- **Contrast:** Ensure all text meets accessibility standards (4.5:1).

## Step 3: Case Study

Tell the story.
- **The Problem:** Why does this app exist?
- **The System:** Show off your colour palette and type scale.
- **The Adaptation:** Show a side-by-side of Phone vs. Tablet. This proves you understand responsive design.
- **The Motion:** Embed a GIF of your prototype.

## Step 4: File Organisation

Clean up.
- **Cover Page:** Make a nice thumbnail.
- **Pages:** Separate "Work in Progress" from "Final Assets".
- **Exports:** Export your screens as high-res PNGs for your portfolio.

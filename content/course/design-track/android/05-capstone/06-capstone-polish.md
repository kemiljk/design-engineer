# Capstone: Polish & Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Create your adaptive icon, conduct a design audit, and write your case study.

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Designing an adaptive icon
- Conducting a thorough design audit
- Writing a case study
- Organising files for portfolio

## Step 1: Adaptive Icon

Design your app icon:
- **Foreground:** Your icon graphic (108dp with 66dp safe zone)
- **Background:** Colour or pattern layer
- **Themed variant:** Monochrome version for Material You

## Step 2: Design Audit

Review everything:
- Consistent with Material 3?
- All states complete?
- Spacing follows 4dp grid?
- Typography scale correct?
- Colour contrast accessible (4.5:1)?
- Dynamic colour works?

## Step 3: Case Study

Document your process:
- **Challenge:** What problem does the app solve?
- **Research:** What did you learn about Material 3?
- **Process:** How did you approach the design?
- **Decisions:** Key choices (especially Material-specific)
- **Results:** Final designs and prototype

## Step 4: File Organisation

Structure for portfolio:
- Cover page
- Material 3 design system
- Phone screens (light)
- Phone screens (dark)
- Dynamic colour variations
- Tablet layouts
- Component library
- Prototype documentation

# Capstone Project: Design a Complete Android App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to design a complete, portfolio-worthy Android app with Material 3 components, adaptive layouts, dynamic colour support, and an interactive prototype.

## Why This Project?

Android apps showcase unique skills:

- **Material 3 expertise** — The latest design system
- **Dynamic colour understanding** — Material You
- **Adaptive design** — Phones, tablets, foldables
- **Motion design** — Material motion system
- **Component architecture** — Material components

**Total Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Complete Android App Design** — 5-7 core screens with light/dark mode and dynamic colour
2. **Material 3 Component Library** — Navigation, FABs, cards, inputs
3. **Adaptive Layouts** — Phone and tablet adaptations
4. **Interactive Prototype** — Material motion transitions
5. **App Icon & Assets** — Adaptive icon with themed variant

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Productivity App
Design an app that helps users get things done (task manager, habit tracker, notes).

### Option B: Lifestyle App
Design an app for personal improvement (fitness tracker, meditation, recipe manager).

### Option C: Social/Discovery App
Design an app centred on exploration (event finder, travel planner, local recommendations).

### Option D: Media/Content App
Design a content consumption experience (podcast player, news reader, gallery).

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Material Foundation](./02-capstone-foundation.md) | Research, colour scheme, typography, dynamic colour | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Phone Screen Design](./03-capstone-screens.md) | Core screens, navigation, components | 2-3 hours |
| [3. Adaptive Layouts](./04-capstone-adaptive.md) | Breakpoints, tablet layouts, content adaptation | 1-2 hours |
| [4. Motion & Prototype](./05-capstone-motion.md) | States, Material motion, prototype | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Polish & Documentation](./06-capstone-polish.md) | Adaptive icon, audit, case study | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Material 3 Adherence** | Some Material usage | Strong Material alignment | Exceptional Material fluency |
| **Colour System** | Basic colours | Full light/dark, good contrast | Dynamic colour mastery |
| **Adaptive Design** | Phone only | Phone plus basic tablet | Thoughtful adaptation |
| **Visual Polish** | Basic styling | Clean, consistent | Beautiful Material expression |
| **Motion Design** | Basic transitions | Correct Material patterns | Fluid, purposeful motion |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Good contrast, touch targets | Full a11y, TalkBack-ready |

## Inspiration

Study these Android apps:

**Google Apps:** Google Messages, Google Photos, Google Tasks, Google Calendar

**Third-Party Excellence:** Pocket Casts, Todoist, Sleep as Android

**Material You Showcases:** Most Google apps for dynamic colour

## Tips for Success

1. **Use Material Theme Builder** — Google's tool ensures correct colour math
2. **Reference M3 guidelines constantly** — Keep material.io open
3. **Design real content** — Realistic data makes better designs
4. **Test dynamic colour early** — Don't assume your colours always work
5. **Think adaptive from the start** — Don't leave tablets as an afterthought
6. **Follow the 4dp grid** — Material spacing should feel consistent

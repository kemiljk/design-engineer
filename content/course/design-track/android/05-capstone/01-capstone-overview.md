# Capstone Project: Design a Complete Android App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to design a complete, portfolio-worthy Android app with Material 3 components, adaptive layouts, dynamic colour support, and an interactive prototype.

## Why This Project?

By building this project, you will demonstrate your fluency in the latest Material 3 design system and show a deep understanding of dynamic colour within the Material You framework. Your portfolio will showcase your ability to create adaptive designs for phones, tablets, and foldables, while mastering the Material motion system and sophisticated component architecture.

**Total Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you will have produced a complete Android app design featuring five to seven core screens with full light and dark mode support and dynamic colour integration. This will be supported by a robust Material 3 component library and specific adaptive layout schemes for both phone and tablet form factors. Furthermore, you will create an interactive prototype using Material motion transitions and a final set of assets including a themed adaptive app icon.

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Productivity App
Design an app that helps users get things done (task manager, habit tracker, notes).

### Option B: Lifestyle App
Design an app for personal improvement (fitness tracker, meditation, recipe manager).

### Option C: Social/Discovery App
Design an app centred on exploration (event finder, travel planner, local recommendations).

### Option D: Media/Content App
Design a content consumption experience (podcast player, news reader, gallery).

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Material Foundation](./02-capstone-foundation.md) | Research, colour scheme, typography, dynamic colour | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Phone Screen Design](./03-capstone-screens.md) | Core screens, navigation, components | 2-3 hours |
| [3. Adaptive Layouts](./04-capstone-adaptive.md) | Breakpoints, tablet layouts, content adaptation | 1-2 hours |
| [4. Motion & Prototype](./05-capstone-motion.md) | States, Material motion, prototype | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Polish & Documentation](./06-capstone-polish.md) | Adaptive icon, audit, case study | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Material 3 Adherence** | Some Material usage | Strong Material alignment | Exceptional Material fluency |
| **Colour System** | Basic colours | Full light/dark, good contrast | Dynamic colour mastery |
| **Adaptive Design** | Phone only | Phone plus basic tablet | Thoughtful adaptation |
| **Visual Polish** | Basic styling | Clean, consistent | Beautiful Material expression |
| **Motion Design** | Basic transitions | Correct Material patterns | Fluid, purposeful motion |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Good contrast, touch targets | Full a11y, TalkBack-ready |

## Inspiration

Study these Android apps:

**Google Apps:** Google Messages, Google Photos, Google Tasks, Google Calendar

**Third-Party Excellence:** Pocket Casts, Todoist, Sleep as Android

**Material You Showcases:** Most Google apps for dynamic colour

## Tips for Success

To ensure success, you should use the Material Theme Builder to guarantee correct colour mathematics and reference the official Material 3 guidelines constantly. Designing with realistic content and testing dynamic colour early will prevent unforeseen issues, while thinking adaptively from the outset and strictly following the 4dp grid will ensure a consistent and professional result.

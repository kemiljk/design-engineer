# Capstone: Material Foundation

> **Quick Summary:** Research Material 3, define your app, and create a complete colour scheme with dynamic colour support.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Researching Material 3 guidelines
- Defining app concept and purpose
- Creating Material 3 colour schemes
- Preparing for dynamic colour

## Step 1: Research & Reference

Before designing, understand Material 3:
- Study Google's Material 3 guidelines
- Review 5-10 Android apps with good Material implementation
- Note patterns: navigation rails vs. bars, component usage
- Screenshot effective Material 3 applications

## Step 2: Define Your App

Establish the foundation:
- **App name** (fictional is fine)
- **Core purpose** (one sentence)
- **Target user** (be specific)
- **Key jobs to be done** (3-5 tasks)
- **Personality** (playful, professional, expressive, etc.)

## Step 3: Create Material Colour Scheme

Use Material Theme Builder or design manually:

### Primary Colours

| Token | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Primary | Your brand colour |
| On Primary | Text/icon on primary |
| Primary Container | Lighter variant |
| On Primary Container | Text on container |

### Secondary & Tertiary

| Token | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Secondary | Supporting colour |
| Tertiary | Accent colour |
| Containers | Plus their container variants |

### Surface & Background

| Token | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Surface | Main backgrounds |
| Surface Variant | Card backgrounds |
| Outline | Borders and dividers |

**Create for both light and dark modes.**

## Step 4: Dynamic Colour Preparation

Plan for Material You:
- Test your design with different wallpaper extractions
- Create 2-3 dynamic colour variations
- Ensure design works with any extracted palette
- Identify elements that should use dynamic vs. static colours

## Step 5: Typography with Roboto

Apply Material type scale:

| Style | Size | Weight |
|-------|------|--------|
| Display Large | 57sp | Regular |
| Display Medium | 45sp | Regular |
| Display Small | 36sp | Regular |
| Headline Large | 32sp | Regular |
| Headline Medium | 28sp | Regular |
| Headline Small | 24sp | Regular |
| Title Large | 22sp | Regular |
| Title Medium | 16sp | Medium |
| Title Small | 14sp | Medium |
| Body Large | 16sp | Regular |
| Body Medium | 14sp | Regular |
| Body Small | 12sp | Regular |
| Label Large | 14sp | Medium |
| Label Medium | 12sp | Medium |
| Label Small | 11sp | Medium |

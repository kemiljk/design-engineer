# Capstone: Interaction & Prototype

> **Quick Summary:** Design interaction states and build a connected prototype.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Designing all interaction states
- Planning iOS-appropriate transitions
- Building connected prototypes
- Adding micro-interactions

## Step 1: Interaction States

Design all states:
- **Buttons:** Default, pressed, disabled
- **Controls:** On/off states, selected states
- **Cells:** Default, highlighted, selected
- **Inputs:** Empty, focused, filled, error

## Step 2: Transitions

Plan iOS-appropriate transitions:
- Push navigation (slide from right)
- Modal presentation (slide from bottom)
- Sheet presentation (partial cover)
- Shared element transitions (if applicable)

## Step 3: Build Prototype

Connect your screens:
- Tab bar navigation
- List to detail flows
- Create/edit flows
- Settings navigation
- Modal presentations

## Step 4: Micro-interactions

Add iOS-specific details:
- Spring animations
- Haptic feedback indicators (annotate)
- Pull-to-refresh (if applicable)
- Swipe actions on cells

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] All interactive states designed
- [ ] Transitions match iOS patterns
- [ ] Prototype is navigable and complete
- [ ] Micro-interactions documented

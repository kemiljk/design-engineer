# Capstone: Interaction & Prototype

> **Quick Summary:** Static screens don't tell the whole story. Design the interaction states for your components and build a clickable prototype that feels like a real iOS app.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Creating comprehensive interaction states for UI components
- Planning transitions that mirror native iOS navigation patterns
- Building connected, functional prototypes in Figma
- Using micro-interactions and haptic cues for polish

## Step 1: Interaction States

Every interactive element needs feedback. Design these states as component variants.
Design component variants for buttons in their normal, pressed, and disabled states, and ensure that inputs and list items provide clear visual feedback during interaction, such as a grey background highlight on tap.

## Step 2: Transitions

Define how screens connect. Don't just use "Instant" or "Dissolve." Use native patterns.
Apply a **Push** transition for hierarchical navigation, use **Modal** sheets for temporary tasks, and ensure that tab switches remain instant without sliding.

## Step 3: Build Prototype

Connect your screens in Figma.
Map the primary "happy path" flow to ensure the main task can be completed, verify that back buttons are functional to prevent dead ends, and set up vertical scroll areas for all lists and content pages.

## Step 4: Micro-interactions

Add the polish that makes it feel like iOS.
Polishing the experience involves making toggle switches slide smoothly, animating success states for checkmarks, and annotating where haptic feedback should occur for key interactions.

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] All buttons have a "Pressed" state.
- [ ] Navigation transitions match iOS standards (Push vs. Modal).
- [ ] The prototype allows a user to complete the core task.
- [ ] Back buttons work.

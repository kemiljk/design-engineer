# Capstone: iOS Design System

> **Quick Summary:** Research similar apps, define your concept, and create iOS design tokens.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Researching iOS design patterns
- Defining app concept and purpose
- Creating iOS-specific design tokens
- Setting up light and dark mode

## Step 1: Research & Reference

Before designing, understand the landscape:
- Study 5-10 similar iOS apps
- Review Apple's HIG for your app category
- Note patterns: navigation choices, component usage
- Screenshot specific elements that work well

## Step 2: Define Your App

Establish the foundation:
- **App name** (fictional is fine)
- **Core purpose** (one sentence)
- **Target user** (be specific)
- **Key jobs to be done** (3-5 tasks)
- **Personality** (playful, professional, minimal, etc.)

## Step 3: Create iOS Tokens

### Colour System

| Token | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Primary | Your brand colour + tints/shades |
| Secondary | Accent colour if needed |
| Background | System backgrounds for both modes |
| Label | Text colours per HIG |
| Semantic | Success, warning, destructive |

### Typography (SF Pro)

| Style | Size | Weight |
|-------|------|--------|
| Large Title | 34pt | Bold |
| Title 1 | 28pt | Bold |
| Title 2 | 22pt | Bold |
| Title 3 | 20pt | Semibold |
| Headline | 17pt | Semibold |
| Body | 17pt | Regular |
| Callout | 16pt | Regular |
| Subhead | 15pt | Regular |
| Footnote | 13pt | Regular |
| Caption | 12pt | Regular |

### Spacing

Use iOS standard spacing: 8, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 64

## Step 4: Setup Light & Dark Mode

Create colour styles that adapt:
- Background colours for both modes
- Text colours for both modes
- System colours (iOS semantic colours)
- Your brand colours in both modes

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] App concept defined with clear purpose
- [ ] Reference research complete
- [ ] Colour system with light/dark variants
- [ ] Typography scale using SF Pro
- [ ] Spacing scale defined

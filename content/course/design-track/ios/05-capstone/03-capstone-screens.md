# Capstone: Screen Design

> **Quick Summary:** Plan your information architecture and design core screens using iOS patterns.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Planning information architecture
- Choosing navigation patterns
- Designing core screens
- Using iOS-standard components

## Step 1: Information Architecture

Plan your app structure:
- What are the main tabs/sections?
- How does navigation flow?
- What's the hierarchy of screens?
- Where is the primary action?

## Step 2: Navigation Pattern

Choose appropriate iOS navigation:
- **Tab Bar:** For main sections (max 5)
- **Navigation Stack:** For hierarchical content
- **Modal:** For focused tasks
- **Sheet:** For secondary content

## Step 3: Core Screens

Design your main screens:

**For each screen, define:**
- Purpose (what user accomplishes)
- Key content and components
- Primary and secondary actions
- Navigation (how user arrived, where they can go)

**Start with these:**
1. **Home/Landing:** First screen user sees
2. **List View:** If showing multiple items
3. **Detail View:** Individual item view
4. **Create/Edit:** If user creates content
5. **Settings/Profile:** App configuration

## Step 4: Component Usage

Use iOS-standard components:
- Navigation bars with proper titles
- Tab bars with SF Symbols
- Standard controls (buttons, toggles, steppers)
- System-style lists and cells
- Proper text fields and forms

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] Information architecture mapped
- [ ] Navigation pattern chosen and applied
- [ ] 5-7 core screens designed
- [ ] iOS-standard components used correctly

## The Brief: Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Productivity App
Design an app that helps users get things done:
- **Suggestions:** Task manager, habit tracker, time tracker, note-taking app
- **Key Screens:** Home/dashboard, list view, detail view, create/edit, settings
- **Challenge:** Balance power with simplicity

### Option B: Lifestyle App
Design an app for personal improvement:
- **Suggestions:** Fitness tracker, meditation app, recipe manager, budget tracker
- **Key Screens:** Today view, progress/stats, activity detail, profile, onboarding
- **Challenge:** Make data engaging and motivating

### Option C: Social/Community App
Design an app centered on connection:
- **Suggestions:** Event finder, group activities, local recommendations

- **Challenge:** Create engaging social interactions

### Option D: Utility App
Design a focused tool:
- **Suggestions:** Weather, calculator, converter, document scanner
- **Key Screens:** Main function, results, history, settings
- **Challenge:** Make a single function delightful

## Phase 1: iOS Design System (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Research & Reference
Before designing, understand the landscape:
- Study 5-10 similar iOS apps
- Review Apple's HIG for your app category
- Note patterns: navigation choices, component usage
- Screenshot specific elements that work well

### Step 2: Define Your App
Establish the foundation:
- **App name** (fictional is fine)
- **Core purpose** (one sentence)
- **Target user** (be specific)
- **Key jobs to be done** (3-5 tasks)
- **Personality** (playful, professional, minimal, etc.)

### Step 3: Create iOS Tokens

**Color System:**
```
Primary: [Your brand color + tints/shades]
Secondary: [Accent color if needed]
Background: [System backgrounds for both modes]
Label: [Text colors per HIG]
Semantic: [Success, warning, destructive]
```

**Typography (SF Pro):**
```
Large Title: 34pt Bold
Title 1: 28pt Bold
Title 2: 22pt Bold
Title 3: 20pt Semibold
Headline: 17pt Semibold
Body: 17pt Regular
Callout: 16pt Regular
Subhead: 15pt Regular
Footnote: 13pt Regular
Caption: 12pt Regular
```

**Spacing:**
Use iOS standard spacing: 8, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 64

### Step 4: Setup Light & Dark Mode
Create color styles that adapt:
- Background colors for both modes
- Text colors for both modes
- System colors (iOS semantic colors)
- Your brand colors in both modes

### Checkpoint
✓ App concept defined with clear purpose
✓ Reference research complete
✓ Color system with light/dark variants
✓ Typography scale using SF Pro
✓ Spacing scale defined

## Phase 2: Screen Design (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Information Architecture
Plan your app structure:
- What are the main tabs/sections?
- How does navigation flow?
- What's the hierarchy of screens?
- Where is the primary action?

### Step 2: Navigation Pattern
Choose appropriate iOS navigation:
- **Tab Bar:** For main sections (max 5)
- **Navigation Stack:** For hierarchical content
- **Modal:** For focused tasks
- **Sheet:** For secondary content

### Step 3: Core Screens
Design your main screens:

**For each screen, define:**
- Purpose (what user accomplishes)
- Key content and components
- Primary and secondary actions
- Navigation (how user arrived, where they can go)

**Start with these:**
1. **Home/Landing:** First screen user sees
2. **List View:** If showing multiple items
3. **Detail View:** Individual item view
4. **Create/Edit:** If user creates content
5. **Settings/Profile:** App configuration

### Step 4: Component Usage
Use iOS-standard components:
- Navigation bars with proper titles
- Tab bars with SF Symbols
- Standard controls (buttons, toggles, steppers)
- System-style lists and cells
- Proper text fields and forms

### Checkpoint
✓ Information architecture mapped
✓ Navigation pattern chosen and applied
✓ 5-7 core screens designed
✓ iOS-standard components used correctly

## Phase 3: Device Adaptations (1-2 hours)

### Step 1: iPhone Sizes
Design for multiple sizes:
- **Standard:** iPhone 14/15 (390pt width)
- **Pro Max:** iPhone 14/15 Pro Max (430pt width)
- **SE:** iPhone SE (375pt width)

### Step 2: Safe Areas
Ensure proper safe area handling:
- Dynamic Island/notch accommodation
- Home indicator spacing
- Landscape considerations (if applicable)

### Step 3: iPad (Optional but Impressive)
If time allows, consider iPad:
- Sidebar navigation patterns
- Split view layouts
- Pointer/keyboard considerations

### Step 4: Dark Mode
Complete dark mode versions:
- All screens in dark mode
- Verify contrast and readability
- Check elevated surfaces
- Test vibrancy effects

### Checkpoint
✓ Primary iPhone size complete
✓ Size variations addressed
✓ Safe areas handled correctly
✓ Dark mode complete for all screens

## Phase 4: Interaction & Prototype (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Interaction States
Design all states:
- **Buttons:** Default, pressed, disabled
- **Controls:** On/off states, selected states
- **Cells:** Default, highlighted, selected
- **Inputs:** Empty, focused, filled, error

### Step 2: Transitions
Plan iOS-appropriate transitions:
- Push navigation (slide from right)
- Modal presentation (slide from bottom)
- Sheet presentation (partial cover)
- Shared element transitions (if applicable)

### Step 3: Build Prototype
Connect your screens:
- Tab bar navigation
- List to detail flows
- Create/edit flows
- Settings navigation
- Modal presentations

### Step 4: Micro-interactions
Add iOS-specific details:
- Spring animations
- Haptic feedback indicators (annotate)
- Pull-to-refresh (if applicable)
- Swipe actions on cells

### Checkpoint
✓ All interactive states designed
✓ Transitions match iOS patterns
✓ Prototype is navigable and complete
✓ Micro-interactions documented

## Phase 5: Polish & Documentation (1-2 hours)

### Step 1: App Icon
Design your app icon:
- Follow Apple's icon grid
- Works in light and dark mode (iOS 18+)
- Readable at all sizes
- No text (in most cases)
- Creates single sizes: 1024×1024

### Step 2: App Store Assets
Create presentation materials:
- App Store screenshots (6.5" and 5.5")
- Screenshot captions/frames
- Brief app description

### Step 3: Design Audit
Review everything:
- Consistent with HIG?
- All states complete?
- Spacing consistent?
- Typography correct?
- Colors accessible?

### Step 4: Case Study
Document your process:
- **Challenge:** What problem does the app solve?
- **Research:** What did you learn from studying iOS apps?
- **Process:** How did you approach the design?
- **Decisions:** Key design choices and rationale
- **Results:** Final designs and prototype

### Step 5: File Organization
Structure for portfolio:
- Cover page
- iOS design system
- Light mode screens
- Dark mode screens
- Component library
- Prototype documentation

### Checkpoint
✓ App icon complete
✓ App Store assets created
✓ Design audit passed
✓ Case study written
✓ File professionally organized

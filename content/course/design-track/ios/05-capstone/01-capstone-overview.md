# Capstone Project: Design a Complete iOS App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to design a complete, portfolio-worthy iOS app with HIG-compliant components, light and dark mode, and an interactive prototype.

## What You'll Learn

- How to apply iOS design principles to a complete app
- Creating HIG-compliant component libraries
- Designing for both light and dark mode
- Building interactive prototypes
- Documenting design decisions in a case study

## Why This Project?

iOS apps are highly visible portfolio pieces. They showcase:

Designing for iOS requires a deep understanding of standard navigation patterns and components, a mastery of modern design languages, and a thorough command of dark mode. Your work must demonstrate clear device adaptation across various iPhone sizes while maintaining the high standard of visual polish and attention to detail expected in the ecosystem.

**Total Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

Throughout this capstone, you will build a complete iOS app design featuring five to seven core screens in both light and dark mode, supported by a comprehensive component library of navigation and input elements. You will also develop an interactive prototype to demonstrate transitions, design the necessary app icon and Store assets, and document your decision-making process in a formal case study.

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Productivity App
Design an app that helps users get things done (task manager, habit tracker, note-taking).

### Option B: Lifestyle App
Design an app for personal improvement (fitness tracker, meditation, recipe manager).

### Option C: Social/Community App
Design an app centred on connection (event finder, group activities, local recommendations).

### Option D: Utility App
Design a focused tool (weather, calculator, converter, document scanner).

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. iOS Design System](./02-capstone-design-system.md) | Research, tokens, light/dark mode setup | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Screen Design](./03-capstone-screens.md) | Core screens, navigation patterns | 2-3 hours |
| [3. Device Adaptations](./04-capstone-devices.md) | iPhone sizes, safe areas, dark mode | 1-2 hours |
| [4. Interaction & Prototype](./05-capstone-prototype.md) | States, transitions, prototype | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Polish & Documentation](./06-capstone-polish.md) | App icon, assets, case study | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **HIG Adherence** | Some iOS patterns | Strong HIG alignment | Exceptional iOS fluency |
| **Visual Polish** | Basic styling | Clean, consistent | Beautiful, refined |
| **Dark Mode** | Basic inversion | Well-considered | Seamless, beautiful in both modes |
| **Component Quality** | Components exist | Complete with states | Production-ready |
| **Navigation** | Basic navigation | Clear, predictable | Intuitive, feels native |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Good contrast, labels | Full a11y consideration |

## Inspiration

Study these iOS apps:

**Productivity:** Things 3, Fantastical, Bear

**Lifestyle:** Nike Training Club, Headspace, YNAB

**Utilities:** Apple Weather, Apple Calculator, Halide

**System Apps:** Study Apple's own apps for the gold standard

## Tips for Success

To ensure success, use SF Symbols for consistent iconography, refer to the Human Interface Guidelines constantly, and populate your designs with realistic content. You should also test dark mode early in the process, pay close attention to granular visual details, and thoroughly prototype your navigation to ensure it feels native to the platform.

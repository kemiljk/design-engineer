# Capstone Project: Design a Complete iOS App

> **Quick Summary:** Apply everything you've learned to design a complete, portfolio-worthy iOS app with HIG-compliant components, light and dark mode, and an interactive prototype.

## Why This Project?

iOS apps are highly visible portfolio pieces. They showcase:

- **HIG understanding** — Navigation, components, patterns
- **Platform expertise** — iOS-specific design language
- **Dark mode mastery** — Essential for modern iOS
- **Device adaptation** — iPhone sizes, potentially iPad
- **Polish and attention to detail** — The iOS standard

**Total Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Complete iOS App Design** — 5-7 core screens with light and dark mode
2. **iOS Component Library** — Navigation, inputs, content components
3. **Interactive Prototype** — Navigation flows and transitions
4. **App Icon & Assets** — App icon and App Store previews
5. **Case Study Documentation** — Process and decisions explained

## Choose Your App

Select one of these app types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Productivity App
Design an app that helps users get things done (task manager, habit tracker, note-taking).

### Option B: Lifestyle App
Design an app for personal improvement (fitness tracker, meditation, recipe manager).

### Option C: Social/Community App
Design an app centred on connection (event finder, group activities, local recommendations).

### Option D: Utility App
Design a focused tool (weather, calculator, converter, document scanner).

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. iOS Design System](./02-capstone-design-system.md) | Research, tokens, light/dark mode setup | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Screen Design](./03-capstone-screens.md) | Core screens, navigation patterns | 2-3 hours |
| [3. Device Adaptations](./04-capstone-devices.md) | iPhone sizes, safe areas, dark mode | 1-2 hours |
| [4. Interaction & Prototype](./05-capstone-prototype.md) | States, transitions, prototype | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Polish & Documentation](./06-capstone-polish.md) | App icon, assets, case study | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **HIG Adherence** | Some iOS patterns | Strong HIG alignment | Exceptional iOS fluency |
| **Visual Polish** | Basic styling | Clean, consistent | Beautiful, refined |
| **Dark Mode** | Basic inversion | Well-considered | Seamless, beautiful in both modes |
| **Component Quality** | Components exist | Complete with states | Production-ready |
| **Navigation** | Basic navigation | Clear, predictable | Intuitive, feels native |
| **Accessibility** | Not considered | Good contrast, labels | Full a11y consideration |

## Inspiration

Study these iOS apps:

**Productivity:** Things 3, Fantastical, Bear

**Lifestyle:** Nike Training Club, Headspace, YNAB

**Utilities:** Apple Weather, Apple Calculator, Halide

**System Apps:** Study Apple's own apps for the gold standard

## Tips for Success

1. **Use SF Symbols** — Apple's icon library ensures consistency
2. **Reference HIG constantly** — Keep Apple's documentation open
3. **Design real content** — Realistic data makes better designs
4. **Test dark mode early** — Don't leave it until the end
5. **Mind the details** — iOS users notice fit and finish
6. **Prototype thoroughly** — Navigation feel matters on iOS

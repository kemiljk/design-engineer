# Capstone: Polish & Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Create app icon, assets, and document your process.

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Designing an app icon
- Creating App Store assets
- Conducting a design audit
- Writing a case study

## Step 1: App Icon

Design your app icon:
- Follow Apple's icon grid
- Works in light and dark mode (iOS 18+)
- Readable at all sizes
- No text (in most cases)
- Create at 1024×1024

## Step 2: App Store Assets

Create presentation materials:
- App Store screenshots (6.5" and 5.5")
- Screenshot captions/frames
- Brief app description

## Step 3: Design Audit

Review everything:
- Consistent with HIG?
- All states complete?
- Spacing consistent?
- Typography correct?
- Colours accessible?

## Step 4: Case Study

Document your process:
- **Challenge:** What problem does the app solve?
- **Research:** What did you learn from studying iOS apps?
- **Process:** How did you approach the design?
- **Decisions:** Key design choices and rationale
- **Results:** Final designs and prototype

## Step 5: File Organisation

Structure for portfolio:
- Cover page
- iOS design system
- Light mode screens
- Dark mode screens
- Component library
- Prototype documentation

# Capstone: Polish & Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Finish strong. Design the app icon, create App Store assets, and document your process. This is what turns a project into a portfolio piece.

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## What You'll Learn

In this final phase, you will discover the nuances of designing a cohesive app icon and crafting compelling App Store assets that effectively communicate your app's value. We'll explore the process of conducting a thorough design audit to ensure platform consistency and learn how to write a detailed case study that documents your decision-making and problem-solving process for your portfolio.

## Step 1: App Icon

The icon is the face of your app.
When designing your app icon, use the Apple Icon Grid to maintain simplicity and a bold appearance. While the OS provides the final mask, you should design the full square assets at 1024x1024 to ensure high quality.

## Step 2: App Store Assets

How do you sell your app?
Create a set of three to five screenshots with punchy captions highlighting the app's value, ensuring you have at least one size that translates well across modern iPhone displays.

## Step 3: Design Audit

Before you call it done, review your work.
Conduct a final audit to ensure consistent 16pt margins and system typography styles, verifying that all text meets AA contrast standards and replacing any placeholder text with realistic content.

## Step 4: Case Study

Document your thinking. A pretty picture isn't enough; hiring managers want to see your brain.
Your case study should clearly articulate the problem you solved, the final design solution, and the iterative process including wireframes and key decisions that led to the final outcome.

## Step 5: File Organisation

Clean up your Figma file.
Finalise your file by deleting unused explorations, naming all layers semantically, and adding a clear cover thumbnail for easy identification in Figma.

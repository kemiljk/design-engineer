# Capstone: Polish & Documentation

> **Quick Summary:** Finish strong. Design the app icon, create App Store assets, and document your process. This is what turns a project into a portfolio piece.

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## What You'll Learn

- Designing an app icon
- Creating App Store assets
- Conducting a design audit
- Writing a case study

## Step 1: App Icon

The icon is the face of your app.
- **Grid:** Use the Apple Icon Grid template.
- **Simplicity:** Keep it bold. Avoid small text or complex photographic details.
- **Background:** Unlike Android, the background mask is provided by the OS, but you design the full square.
- **Assets:** Create the 1024x1024 version.

## Step 2: App Store Assets

How do you sell your app?
- **Screenshots:** Create a set of 3-5 screenshots.
- **Captions:** Add a short, punchy sentence above each phone frame explaining the value ("Track your habits," "Stay focused").
- **Sizes:** You ideally need a 6.5" version and a 5.5" version, but for this capstone, one size is sufficient.

## Step 3: Design Audit

Before you call it done, review your work.
- **Consistency:** Are margins always 16pt?
- **Typography:** Did you accidentally use a custom font size instead of a style?
- **Contrast:** Does every text label meet AA standards?
- **Content:** Is the placeholder text realistic? Replace "Lorem Ipsum" with real content.

## Step 4: Case Study

Document your thinking. A pretty picture isn't enough; hiring managers want to see your brain.
- **Problem:** What were you solving?
- **Solution:** How did you solve it?
- **Process:** Show your wireframes, your bad ideas, and your final polish.
- **Outcome:** What did you learn?

## Step 5: File Organisation

Clean up your Figma file.
- **Delete** unused pages.
- **Name** your layers.
- **Thumbnail:** Add a "Cover" page with a nice thumbnail so it looks good in the file browser.

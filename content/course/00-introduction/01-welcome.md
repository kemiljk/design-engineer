# Welcome to the Design Engineer Course

> **Quick Summary:** You're about to learn how to bridge the gap between design and engineering. It's a skill set that's increasingly valuable and deeply rewarding.

## What You'll Learn

- What this course will help you achieve
- Who this course is for
- The mindset shift that makes Design Engineers effective
- How to get the most out of your learning journey

## Welcome, Future Design Engineer

If you've ever felt stuck between two worlds, loving the craft of design but wanting to build, or writing code while wishing you had a better eye for aesthetics, you're in the right place.

This course exists because the gap between design and engineering isn't a problem to solve. It's an opportunity to own.

Design Engineers are the people who refuse to hand off their work and hope for the best. They prototype their ideas. They understand constraints. They speak both languages fluently enough to translate between teams, catch issues early, and ship work that's both beautiful and functional.

That's what we're building towards.

## Who This Course Is For

This course welcomes two types of learners:

### Designers Learning to Build

You've got the eye. You understand hierarchy, spacing, colour, and composition. But when it comes to implementation, you're dependent on someone else. You want to:

- Prototype your ideas in code, not just in Figma
- Understand what's possible (and what's expensive) before you design it
- Ship side projects on your own
- Have more productive conversations with engineers

### Engineers Learning to Design

You can build anything—but "anything" sometimes looks like it was designed by a developer. You want to:

- Develop taste and a critical eye
- Understand the principles behind good design decisions
- Create work that's polished without needing a designer's review
- Move faster by handling both sides yourself

If you're somewhere in between, even better. This course meets you where you are.

## The Design Engineer Mindset

Before we get into skills, let's talk about mindset. The most effective Design Engineers share a few traits:

### Curiosity Over Territory

They don't think "that's not my job." When something breaks at the seam between design and engineering, they fix it. Or at least understand it well enough to help.

### Iteration Over Perfection

They prototype, test, and refine. They know that a rough version in code teaches more than a polished mockup that never ships.

### Empathy in Both Directions

They understand why designers obsess over 2px of spacing and why engineers worry about performance implications. They translate, mediate, and advocate.

### Craftsmanship

They care about the details that most people won't notice, but that everyone feels. The animation that's just right. The interaction that feels natural. The edge case that's handled gracefully.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, depending on your path, you'll be able to:

- **Design confidently**: Apply visual design principles, build in design tools, create and maintain design systems
- **Build fluently**: Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or Swift/Kotlin) that brings designs to life
- **Bridge the gap**: Prototype ideas, implement motion design, ensure accessibility, and ship polished work

You won't just learn theory. Every module includes hands-on exercises, real examples, and projects that build your portfolio.

## How to Approach This Course

This isn't a passive course. You'll get out what you put in.

**Go at your own pace.** There's no deadline. Some lessons will click immediately; others will require practice. Both are fine.

**Build as you learn.** Each lesson has exercises. Do them. The gap between "understanding" and "knowing" is crossed by building.

**Be patient with yourself.** If you're a designer learning to code, your first attempts will feel clumsy. If you're an engineer learning design, your early work won't look like Dribbble shots. That's part of the process.

**Connect concepts across tracks.** The best learning happens when you see how typography principles show up in CSS, or how component architecture in Figma mirrors component architecture in code.

## Let's Begin

In the next lesson, we'll explore what Design Engineering actually is: where it came from, what it looks like in practice, and why it's becoming such an important role.

Your journey to becoming a Design Engineer starts now.

## Key Takeaways

- Design Engineering bridges the gap between design and code
- This course welcomes both designers learning to build and engineers learning to design
- The DE mindset values curiosity, iteration, empathy, and craftsmanship
- Active practice is essential. Build as you learn.

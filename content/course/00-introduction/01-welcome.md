# Welcome to the Design Engineer Course

> **Quick Summary:** You're about to learn how to bridge the gap between design and engineering. It's a skill set that's increasingly valuable and deeply rewarding.

## What You'll Learn

- What you can achieve as a design engineer
- The core mindset shifts that make design engineers effective
- Who this course is designed for
- Practical strategies to get the most from your learning experience

## Welcome, Future Design Engineer

If you've ever felt caught between two worlds—loving design but wanting to build, or writing code whilst wishing you had a better eye for aesthetics—you're in the right place.

The gap between design and engineering isn't a problem to solve. It's an opportunity to own.

Design Engineers refuse to hand off their work and hope for the best. They prototype ideas, understand constraints, and speak both languages fluently enough to translate between teams, catch issues early, and ship work that's both beautiful and functional.

## Who This Course Is For

This course welcomes two types of students:

### Designers Learning to Build

You've got the eye. You understand hierarchy, spacing, colour, and composition. But when it comes to implementation, you're dependent on someone else. You want to:

Designers move from static mocks to dynamic reality by learning to prototype their ideas in code rather than just Figma. By understanding what is technically possible—and what might be expensive to build—you can have more productive conversations with engineers and ultimately ship your own side projects independently.

### Engineers Learning to Design

You can build anything—but "anything" sometimes looks like it was designed by a developer. You want to:

Engineers develop a critical eye for aesthetics and a deep understanding of the principles behind strong design decisions. This allows you to create polished work that doesn't always require a designer's review, enabling you to move faster by handling both sides of the development cycle yourself.

If you're somewhere in between, even better. This course meets you where you are.

## The Design Engineer Mindset

Before skills, let's talk about mindset. The most effective Design Engineers share a few traits:

### Curiosity Over Territory

They don't think "that's not my job." When something breaks at the seam between design and engineering, they fix it—or understand it well enough to help.

### Iteration Over Perfection

They prototype, test, and refine. A rough version in code teaches more than a polished mockup that never ships.

### Empathy in Both Directions

They understand why designers obsess over 2px of spacing and why engineers worry about performance. They translate, mediate, and advocate.

### Craftsmanship

They care about the details most people won't notice but everyone feels. The animation that's just right. The interaction that feels natural. The edge case that's handled gracefully.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, depending on your path, you'll be able to:

By the end of your chosen track, you will be able to design confidently by applying visual principles within professional design tools and creating robust systems. You'll move fluently between design and code, writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—or Swift and Kotlin—needed to bring your interfaces to life while implementing motion design and ensuring total accessibility.

You won't just learn theory. Every module includes hands-on exercises, real examples, and projects that build your portfolio.

## How to Approach This Course

This isn't a passive course. You get out what you put in.

**Go at your own pace.** There's no deadline. Some lessons click immediately; others need practice. Both are fine.

**Build as you learn.** Each lesson has exercises. Do them. The gap between understanding and knowing is crossed by building.

**Be patient with yourself.** If you're a designer learning to code, your first attempts will feel clumsy. If you're an engineer learning design, your early work won't look like Dribbble shots. That's normal.

**Connect concepts across tracks.** The best learning happens when you see how typography principles appear in CSS, or how component architecture in Figma mirrors component architecture in code.

## Let's Begin

In the next lesson, we'll explore what Design Engineering actually is: where it came from, what it looks like in practice, and why it's becoming such an important role.

Your journey to becoming a Design Engineer starts now.

## Key Takeaways

- Design engineering bridges the gap between design and code
- It welcomes both designers learning to build and engineers developing their eye
- Success requires a mindset valuing curiosity, iteration, empathy, and craftsmanship
- These skills are best developed through active practice and building as you learn

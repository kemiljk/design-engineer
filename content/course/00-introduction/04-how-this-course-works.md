# How This Course Works

> **Quick Summary:** This lesson explains the course structure, how to navigate between lessons, and how to get the most from your learning experience.

## What You'll Learn

- The overarching structure of lessons and modules
- How to navigate between lessons effectively
- Practical tips for successful learning
- How to track your progress throughout the track

## Course Organization

The course is organised into three main sections, each with platform-specific content:

```text
├── Introduction (you are here)
│
├── Design Track
│   ├── Web
│   ├── iOS
│   └── Android
│
├── Engineering Track
│   ├── Web
│   ├── iOS
│   └── Android
│
└── Convergence
    ├── Web
    ├── iOS
    └── Android
```

Within each track and platform, content is organised into **modules** (major topics) and **lessons** (individual units within a topic).

For example, the Web Engineering Track:
For example, the Web Engineering Track is divided into five core modules, starting with six lessons on HTML Fundamentals and eight on CSS Mastery. You will then progress through eight lessons on JavaScript Essentials, six on Building Components, and finally five lessons dedicated to Design Systems in Code.

## Lesson Structure

Every lesson follows a consistent format:

### Quick Summary
A one-line takeaway at the top. If you're reviewing or skimming, this tells you what the lesson covers.

### What You'll Learn
Bullet points of outcomes. After completing the lesson, you should be able to do these things.

### Main Content
The core teaching, broken into digestible sections. This includes:
The main content provides the core teaching through digestible sections that include detailed explanations of concepts and practical code examples for engineering lessons. Design students will find visual examples to guide their work, while everyone benefits from the real-world context and applications provided.

### Try It Yourself
Hands-on exercises. This is where learning happens. Reading about design won't make you a designer; designing will. Reading about code won't make you an engineer; coding will.

Don't skip these.

### Key Takeaways
A summary of main points. Good for review and reference.

### Next Steps
Links to continue your journey—usually the next lesson, but sometimes related lessons in other tracks.

## Navigation Approaches

There are two main ways to move through the course:

### Linear Progression (Recommended for Beginners)

Work through lessons in order within your chosen track:
To follow a linear progression, you should work through the lessons in order within your chosen track. This means completing all lessons in Module 1 before moving to Module 2, and continuing through all subsequent modules before proceeding to the next professional track.

This ensures you build foundational knowledge before tackling advanced topics.

### Topic-Based Exploration (For Experienced Learners)

If you already have skills in some areas, jump to what you need:
If you already possess skills in certain areas, you may choose to skip lessons covering concepts you already know and jump directly into specific topics. We encourage you to cross-reference between tracks whenever you find relevant connections.

Be honest with yourself. If a lesson's "What You'll Learn" includes things you can't confidently do, work through it.

## Cross-Track Learning

Many concepts appear in both the Design and Engineering tracks, approached from different angles:

| Concept | Design Track | Engineering Track |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Components | Designing reusable UI elements | Building reusable UI elements |
| Typography | Choosing and pairing fonts | Implementing type systems in code |
| Colour | Building palettes and systems | Implementing theming |
| Layout | Grid systems and composition | Flexbox, Grid, and layout code |
| Motion | Animation principles | Animation implementation |

When you encounter a concept in one track, consider exploring it in the other. Understanding both perspectives is what makes a Design Engineer.

## Progress Tracking

### The Course Plan

The `/content/course/_meta/COURSE-PLAN.md` file contains:
- A complete outline of all modules and lessons
- Checkboxes for tracking completion
- Cross-references between related content

Use this as your roadmap. Mark lessons complete as you finish them.

### Self-Assessment

At the start of each module, assess what you already know. At the end, assess what you've learned. The gap between these tells you the value you're getting.

### Building Evidence

The best way to track progress is to build. As you complete exercises:
As you complete exercises, make sure to save your work in a dedicated folder and take screenshots of your design projects. You should commit your code exercises to a repository and take the time to note down any specific insights or questions that arise.

By the end, you'll have a collection of work that demonstrates your skills—useful for portfolios and job applications.

## Tips for Effective Learning

### Space Your Learning

Spaced repetition beats cramming. Instead of marathon sessions:
To space your learning effectively, try to study for only 30 to 60 minutes at a time and take regular breaks between lessons. It's often helpful to review previous lessons before starting new ones and allow yourself time to sleep on complex concepts.

### Teach What You Learn

The best way to solidify understanding is to explain it to someone else. After each lesson:
After each lesson, solidify your understanding by summarising the main points in your own words and explaining new concepts to a friend or colleague. You might even consider writing a blog post or social media update about what you have learned.

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

### Embrace Confusion

Feeling confused is a sign you're learning. When concepts feel hard:
When concepts feel particularly difficult, take a break and return to them later, but try the exercises even if you don't fully understand everything yet. Don't hesitate to look up supplementary resources or ask questions of colleagues, community members, or AI models.

Don't expect everything to click immediately. Learning is non-linear.

### Connect Concepts

Design Engineering is about seeing connections. As you learn:
As you learn, try to note when concepts from different lessons relate to each other and consider how design principles appear in code. You should also think about how various engineering constraints might influence your overall design process.

The "aha" moments come when you connect ideas across disciplines.

### Build, Build, Build

Reading isn't learning. Doing is learning.

Every exercise exists for a reason. Even if an exercise feels simple, do it. Building creates understanding that reading cannot.

After completing each module, build something on your own that uses what you learned. This is how you move from "I've seen this" to "I can do this."

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

If you find yourself stuck, re-read the lesson and work through the exercises, as these often clarify difficult concepts. You can also look at related lessons in other tracks, search for the concept online for a different explanation, or simply take a break to return with fresh eyes.

### Community Resources

Consider joining communities where you can ask questions:
Consider joining dedicated Design Engineering Slack or Discord communities, as well as platform-specific forums and social media groups focused on design and development.

## Time Expectations

Here's a rough guide for how long each section takes:

| Section | Modules | Estimated Hours |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Introduction | 1 | 1-2 hours |
| Design Track (Web) | 5 | 15-25 hours |
| Engineering Track (Web) | 5 | 25-40 hours |
| Convergence (Web) | 5 | 15-25 hours |

These estimates assume:
- You're learning the content for the first time
- You complete all exercises
- You build additional projects to practice

Experienced students move faster. Complete beginners may need more time. Both are fine.

## Try It Yourself

Before diving into your chosen track:

1. **Set up your environment.** Depending on your path:
Web students should set up a code editor like VS Code and a modern browser, while those on the iOS track will need Xcode on a Mac. Android students will require a proper installation of Android Studio.

You should also create a dedicated learning folder for your projects, familiarise yourself with the structure of the Course Plan, and set a committed schedule for your weekly study time.

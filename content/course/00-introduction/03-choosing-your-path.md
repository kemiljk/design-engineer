# Choosing Your Path

> **Quick Summary:** This course offers multiple tracks and platforms. Here's how to choose the right path for your background, goals, and interests.

## What You'll Learn

- How to assess your current skill level
- The difference between the Design and Engineering tracks
- How to choose your platform (Web, iOS, or Android)
- When to pursue the Convergence track

## The Course Structure

This course is designed as a "Choose Your Own Adventure." Instead of a single linear path, you'll select:

1. **A Track**: Design (for engineers) or Engineering (for designers)
2. **A Platform**: Web, iOS, or Android
3. **Convergence**: The advanced track where both skills merge

Let's figure out what's right for you.

## Self-Assessment: Where Are You Starting?

Before choosing a path, honestly assess your current skills. Rate each skill from 0-3, and we'll recommend the best track for you.

## Choosing Your Track

### Take the Design Track If...

Your **engineering score is higher** than your design score, or:

- You can build things but they don't look great
- You struggle to make aesthetic decisions confidently
- You want to understand *why* designers make certain requests
- You want to ship beautiful, polished interfaces—not just functional code
- You want to develop real design taste, not just follow templates

**Develop design taste that AI can't replicate.** You already know how to code—now learn to make confident visual decisions. This track gives you fundamentals that compound: skills that make your work beautiful, not just functional.

The Design Track covers:
- Visual design fundamentals
- Typography, colour, and spacing
- Design tools and workflows
- Design systems
- UX principles

### Take the Engineering Track If...

Your **design score is higher** than your engineering score, or:

- You're comfortable in design tools but can't code your ideas
- You've tried Vibe Coding (prompting AI) but the results feel hollow
- You want real engineering skills—not just generated outputs
- You want to ship side projects yourself
- You're tired of designs getting "lost in translation"

**Go beyond Vibe Coding.** AI can generate code, but it can't teach you to build with intention. This track gives you fundamentals that compound: skills that let you own the entire build process, not just prompt and hope.

The Engineering Track covers:
- Terminal, environment setup, and tooling
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals (for Web)
- Building UI components
- State management
- Design systems in code

### What If You're Balanced?

If your scores are similar:

1. **Pick based on interest.** Which excites you more: learning to see like a designer or learning to build like an engineer?

2. **Pick based on role.** What does your job (or desired job) need more?

3. **Start with Engineering.** If truly undecided, engineering skills are faster to validate—you either built it or you didn't. Design skills can feel more subjective when learning.

## Choosing Your Platform

### Web

**Choose Web if:**
- You want the broadest applicability
- You're interested in websites, web apps, or cross-platform work
- You want to build things that work everywhere
- You're new to both design and development (web has the lowest barrier to entry)

**Web Track covers:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Responsive design
- Modern frameworks (conceptually)
- Web-specific design considerations

### iOS (SwiftUI)

**Choose iOS if:**
- You're specifically interested in Apple platforms
- You want to build iPhone, iPad, or Mac apps
- You appreciate Apple's design philosophy
- You're already in the Apple ecosystem

**iOS Track covers:**
- Swift programming language
- SwiftUI framework
- Human Interface Guidelines
- iOS-specific design patterns

### Android (Jetpack Compose)

**Choose Android if:**
- You're specifically interested in Android development
- You want to build for the largest mobile platform globally
- You appreciate Material Design
- You're already using Android devices

**Android Track covers:**
- Kotlin programming language
- Jetpack Compose framework
- Material Design principles
- Android-specific design patterns

### Can I Do Multiple Platforms?

Yes, but master one first. The concepts transfer—visual hierarchy helps on any platform, and component thinking works everywhere.

Once you're comfortable on one platform, picking up another is faster. The fundamentals are portable; only the syntax changes.

## The Convergence Track

The Convergence track is where Design Engineering comes together. It's for people who:

- Have completed both the Design and Engineering tracks for their platform
- Already have strong skills in both areas
- Want to focus on the *bridge* between design and engineering

**Convergence covers:**
- Motion and animation
- Prototyping workflows
- Accessibility deep dive
- Performance and polish
- Building a DE portfolio and workflow

You don't have to complete both tracks before starting Convergence, but you should be comfortable with the fundamentals of both design and engineering for your platform.

## Recommended Paths

Based on common scenarios:

### "I'm a designer who wants to go beyond Vibe Coding"

1. Start with **Engineering Track (Web)**—learn to build properly, not just prompt
2. Move to **Convergence** when comfortable
3. Optional: Add iOS or Android later

### "I'm an engineer who wants to ship beautiful, polished UIs"

1. Start with **Design Track (Web)**—develop real design taste
2. Move to **Convergence** when comfortable
3. Apply learnings to your existing platform expertise

### "I want to build iOS apps from scratch"

1. Start with **Design Track (iOS)** if design is weaker
2. Or **Engineering Track (iOS)** if engineering is weaker
3. Complete the other track
4. Finish with **Convergence (iOS)**

### "I want to be a well-rounded web Design Engineer"

1. Start with your weaker track
2. Complete the other track
3. Complete **Convergence (Web)**

### "I'm starting from zero"

1. Start with **Engineering Track (Web)**—it's the most accessible entry point
2. Move to **Design Track (Web)** when you can build basic pages
3. Finish with **Convergence (Web)**

## Try It Yourself

Based on your self-assessment:

1. **Choose your first track:** Design or Engineering
2. **Choose your platform:** Web, iOS, or Android
3. **Write down your goal:** "By completing this track, I'll be able to ___________."

Your choices aren't permanent. You can switch if another path suits you better. But committing helps you make progress.

## Key Takeaways

- Assess your skills honestly before choosing a path
- Designers: go beyond Vibe Coding—develop real engineering skills AI can't replicate
- Engineers: develop design taste—ship beautiful, polished UIs, not just functional code
- Start with one platform and master it before adding others
- The Convergence track ties everything together
- Your path isn't permanent—you can adjust as you learn

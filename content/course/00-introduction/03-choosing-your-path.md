# Choosing Your Path

> **Quick Summary:** This course offers multiple tracks and platforms. Here's how to choose the right path for your background, goals, and interests.

## What You'll Learn

- How to accurately assess your current skill level
- The difference between design and engineering tracks
- How to choose the right platform (web, ios, or android)
- When to pursue the advanced convergence track

## The Course Structure

This course is designed as a "Choose Your Own Adventure." Instead of a single linear path, you'll select:

This course is designed as a "Choose Your Own Adventure" rather than a single linear path. You'll begin by selecting between the Design track for engineers or the Engineering track for designers, followed by your preferred platform of Web, iOS, or Android. Finally, you can choose to merge these abilities in the advanced Convergence track.

Let's figure out what's right for you.

## Self-Assessment: Where Are You Starting?

Before choosing a path, honestly assess your current skills. Rate each skill from 0-3, and we'll recommend the best track for you.

## Choosing Your Track

### Take the Design Track If...

Your **engineering score is higher** than your design score, or:

The Design track is perfect for those who can build functional products but find them lacking in aesthetic quality or struggle to make confident visual decisions. If you want to understand the reasoning behind designer requests and develop a genuine taste for beautiful, polished interfaces rather than just following a template, this is your starting point.

**Develop design taste that AI can't replicate.** You already know how to code—now learn to make confident visual decisions. This track gives you fundamentals that compound: skills that make your work beautiful, not just functional.

The Design Track covers:
The Design track provides a deep dive into visual fundamentals, including typography, colour, and spacing. You will master professional design tools and workflows while learning to build robust design systems and applying core UX principles to your work.

### Take the Engineering Track If...

Your **design score is higher** than your engineering score, or:

You should opt for the Engineering track if you are already comfortable with design tools but find yourself unable to code your ideas effectively. If you're tired of designs getting "lost in translation" or relying on hollow AI-generated outputs, this track will provide the real engineering foundations needed to ship your own side projects with total intention.

**Go beyond Vibe Coding.** AI can generate code, but it can't teach you to build with intention. This track gives you fundamentals that compound: skills that let you own the entire build process, not just prompt and hope.

The Engineering Track covers:
The Engineering track covers everything from terminal and environment setup to mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web. You'll learn to build complex UI components, manage state effectively, and translate your design systems into robust production code.

### What If You're Balanced?

If your scores are similar:

1. **Pick based on interest.** Which excites you more: learning to see like a designer or learning to build like an engineer?

2. **Pick based on role.** What does your job (or desired job) need more?

3. **Start with Engineering.** If truly undecided, engineering skills are faster to validate—you either built it or you didn't. Design skills can feel more subjective when learning.

## Choosing Your Platform

### Web

**Choose Web if:**
Web is the ideal choice if you seek the broadest platform applicability for websites and web apps that work across all devices. Because it has the lowest barrier to entry, it's particularly well-suited for those who are entirely new to both design and development.

**Web Track covers:**
The Web track focuses on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive designs. You will also explore modern framework concepts and the specific design considerations unique to the web ecosystem.

### iOS (SwiftUI)

**Choose iOS if:**
Select iOS if you are specifically interested in Apple's ecosystem and want to build apps for the iPhone, iPad, or Mac. This platform is perfect for those who already appreciate and want to master Apple's distinct design philosophy and materials.

**iOS Track covers:**
The iOS track covers the Swift programming language and the SwiftUI framework in depth. You'll learn to apply the Human Interface Guidelines and master the design patterns specific to the iOS platform.

### Android (Jetpack Compose)

**Choose Android if:**
Android is the best path if you want to build for the world's largest mobile platform and have an appreciation for Google's Material Design system. It's ideally suited for those who are already integrated into the Android ecosystem and want to develop for a wide variety of devices.

**Android Track covers:**
The Android track focuses on the Kotlin programming language and the Jetpack Compose framework. You will master the principles of Material Design and the varied layout and navigation patterns unique to Android.

### Can I Do Multiple Platforms?

Yes, but master one first. The concepts transfer—visual hierarchy helps on any platform, and component thinking works everywhere.

Once you're comfortable on one platform, picking up another is faster. The fundamentals are portable; only the syntax changes.

## The Convergence Track

**The Convergence track** is where Design Engineering comes together. It's designed for those who have completed both the Design and Engineering tracks—or already possess strong skills in both areas—and want to focus specifically on the bridge between them.

Convergence covers motion and animation, advanced prototyping workflows, and a deep dive into accessibility. You'll also focus on implementation performance and polish, while learning how to build a professional design engineering portfolio.

You don't have to complete both tracks before starting Convergence, but you should be comfortable with the fundamentals of both design and engineering for your platform.

## Recommended Paths

Based on common scenarios:

### "I'm a designer who wants to go beyond Vibe Coding"

1. Start with **Engineering Track (Web)**—learn to build properly, not just prompt
2. Move to **Convergence** when comfortable
3. Optional: Add iOS or Android later

### "I'm an engineer who wants to ship beautiful, polished UIs"

1. Start with **Design Track (Web)**—develop real design taste
2. Move to **Convergence** when comfortable
3. Apply learnings to your existing platform expertise

### "I want to build iOS apps from scratch"

1. Start with **Design Track (iOS)** if design is weaker
2. Or **Engineering Track (iOS)** if engineering is weaker
3. Complete the other track
4. Finish with **Convergence (iOS)**

### "I want to be a well-rounded web Design Engineer"

1. Start with your weaker track
2. Complete the other track
3. Complete **Convergence (Web)**

### "I'm starting from zero"

1. Start with **Engineering Track (Web)**—it's the most accessible entry point
2. Move to **Design Track (Web)** when you can build basic pages
3. Finish with **Convergence (Web)**

## Try It Yourself

Based on your self-assessment:

1. **Choose your first track:** Design or Engineering
2. **Choose your platform:** Web, iOS, or Android
3. **Write down your goal:** "By completing this track, I'll be able to ****\_\_\_****."

Your choices aren't permanent. You can switch if another path suits you better. But committing helps you make progress.

## Key Takeaways

- Assess your skills honestly before selecting a path
- Focus on mastering one platform first to learn portable fundamentals
- Merge your abilities in the convergence track after building foundations
- Your path isn't permanent—adjust as you learn and grow

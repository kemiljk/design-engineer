# Prototyping Mindset

> **Quick Summary:** Prototyping is about learning through making. Speed and iteration matter more than perfection.

## What You'll Learn

- Why design engineers are uniquely suited to excel in this experimental phase
- The full spectrum of prototype fidelity—from paper sketches to high-fidelity code—and when to use each
- How to embrace rapid iteration and learning over perfection

## What Is a Prototype?

A prototype is a representation of an idea used to:
- **Test assumptions** before committing resources
- **Communicate vision** more effectively than specs
- **Discover problems** through interaction
- **Build alignment** among stakeholders

A prototype is NOT:
- Production code
- A final design
- Something that needs to be perfect

## The Design Engineer Advantage

As a Design Engineer, you can:
- Go from idea to interactive prototype faster than pure designers
- Build prototypes that feel real (actual code, real interactions)
- Test technical feasibility while exploring design
- Bridge the gap between design mockups and development

This is your superpower. Lean into it.

## The Prototype Spectrum

<!-- illustration: prototype-fidelity -->

### Paper Sketches
- Fidelity: Very low
- Time: Minutes
- Use: Early ideation, flow exploration

### Wireframes
- Fidelity: Low
- Time: Hours
- Use: Layout and structure decisions

### Design Tool Prototypes (Figma, etc.)
- Fidelity: Medium
- Time: Hours to days
- Use: Visual design validation, stakeholder review

### Code Prototypes
- Fidelity: High
- Time: Hours to days
- Use: Interaction testing, technical validation

### Production Prototypes
- Fidelity: Very high
- Time: Days to weeks
- Use: User testing, stakeholder buy-in

## Choosing Fidelity

Ask yourself:
1. **What am I trying to learn?**
2. **Who needs to see this?**
3. **How much time do I have?**

Low fidelity when:
- Testing basic concepts
- Exploring many options
- Internal team review

High fidelity when:
- User testing
- Stakeholder presentations
- Technical feasibility validation

## Overcoming Perfectionism

Prototype rules:
- **Done is better than perfect**
- **Test early, test often**
- **Throw it away if needed**
- **Focus on the hypothesis**

Signs you're over-polishing:
- Spending hours on details users won't test
- Hesitating to share because "it's not ready"
- Building features beyond the test scope
- Treating prototype code as production code

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Speed Prototype

Set a 30-minute timer. Build a functional prototype of a feature idea. Stop when the timer ends, no matter what.

### Exercise 2: Fidelity Comparison

Take one feature concept. Create:
- A paper sketch (5 min)
- A wireframe (15 min)
- A code prototype (30 min)

Compare what you learned from each.

## Key Takeaways

- To master a prototyping mindset, you must remember that prototypes are built for learning and validating hypotheses, not for shipping final code
- By choosing the appropriate fidelity for your specific question, you can move faster and learn more
- Ultimately, embrace the idea that speed and quantity often beat perfection in this phase
- Never be afraid to throw a prototype away once it has served its purpose

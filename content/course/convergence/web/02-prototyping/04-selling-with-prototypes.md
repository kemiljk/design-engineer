# Selling with Prototypes

> **Quick Summary:** Prototypes are powerful persuasion tools. Learn to use them strategically to build alignment and advocate for user experience.

## What You'll Learn

- Prototypes as communication tools
- Presenting to different audiences
- Building organizational buy-in
- Strategic prototype deployment

## The Power of "Show, Don't Tell"

Prototypes are more persuasive than:
- Spec documents
- Slide decks
- Verbal descriptions
- Static mockups

When stakeholders can interact with an idea, they understand it viscerally.

## Know Your Audience

### Engineers
- **Show:** Technical feasibility, architecture hints
- **Focus:** How it works under the hood
- **Skip:** Visual polish (they'll see past it anyway)

### Designers
- **Show:** Interactions, transitions, feel
- **Focus:** How the experience flows
- **Invite:** Collaboration on refinement

### Product Managers
- **Show:** User flows, feature scope
- **Focus:** What problems it solves
- **Highlight:** User research validation

### Executives
- **Show:** The vision, the impact
- **Focus:** Business value, competitive advantage
- **Keep:** High-level, polished

## Presenting Prototypes

### Set Expectations
"This is a prototype to test [specific thing]. It's not production-ready."

### Guide the Experience
"Let me walk you through the happy path first, then you can explore."

### Focus Feedback
"I'm specifically looking for feedback on [interaction/flow/concept]."

### Capture Reactions
Note what excites people, what confuses them, what concerns them.

## Strategic Prototype Uses

### Kill Bad Ideas Early
A quick prototype can reveal why an idea won't work before weeks of development.

### Unlock Resources
"Here's what we could build" is more compelling than "Here's what we might build."

### Build Consensus
When teams disagree, a prototype provides a shared reference point for discussion.

### Test with Users
Real feedback beats internal opinions every time.

## Common Mistakes

### Over-polishing
Spending days on a prototype for a 30-minute meeting wastes time.

### Under-scoping
A prototype that tries to show everything shows nothing clearly.

### No Clear Question
Every prototype should answer a specific question. What's yours?

### Ignoring Feedback
If the prototype reveals the idea is flawed, listen. Don't defend.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Pitch Prototype

Create a 2-minute prototype demo for a feature idea. Practice presenting it:
- To an engineer (focus on feasibility)
- To a PM (focus on user value)
- To an executive (focus on impact)

### Exercise 2: Feedback Session

Share a prototype and gather feedback:
- Set clear expectations
- Ask specific questions
- Note all reactions

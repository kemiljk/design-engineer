# Selling with Prototypes

> **Quick Summary:** Prototypes are powerful persuasion tools. Learn to use them strategically to build alignment and advocate for user experience.

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you will explore the powerful role of prototypes as persuasive communication tools and learn how to tailor your presentations for different audiences, from engineers to executives. We'll examine practical techniques for building organisational buy-in and dive into the strategic deployment of prototypes to kill flawed ideas early, unlock necessary resources, and build consensus across multidisciplinary teams.

## The Power of "Show, Don't Tell"

Prototypes are more persuasive than:
- Spec documents
- Slide decks
- Verbal descriptions
- Static mockups

When stakeholders can interact with an idea, they understand it viscerally.

## Know Your Audience

### Engineers
- **Show:** Technical feasibility, architecture hints
- **Focus:** How it works under the hood
- **Skip:** Visual polish (they'll see past it anyway)

### Designers
- **Show:** Interactions, transitions, feel
- **Focus:** How the experience flows
- **Invite:** Collaboration on refinement

### Product Managers
- **Show:** User flows, feature scope
- **Focus:** What problems it solves
- **Highlight:** User research validation

### Executives
- **Show:** The vision, the impact
- **Focus:** Business value, competitive advantage
- **Keep:** High-level, polished

## Presenting Prototypes

### Set Expectations
"This is a prototype to test [specific thing]. It's not production-ready."

### Guide the Experience
"Let me walk you through the happy path first, then you can explore."

### Focus Feedback
"I'm specifically looking for feedback on [interaction/flow/concept]."

### Capture Reactions
Note what excites people, what confuses them, what concerns them.

## Strategic Prototype Uses

### Kill Bad Ideas Early
A quick prototype can reveal why an idea won't work before weeks of development.

### Unlock Resources
"Here's what we could build" is more compelling than "Here's what we might build."

### Build Consensus
When teams disagree, a prototype provides a shared reference point for discussion.

### Test with Users
Real feedback beats internal opinions every time.

## Common Mistakes

### Over-polishing
Spending days on a prototype for a 30-minute meeting wastes time.

### Under-scoping
A prototype that tries to show everything shows nothing clearly.

### No Clear Question
Every prototype should answer a specific question. What's yours?

### Ignoring Feedback
If the prototype reveals the idea is flawed, listen. Don't defend.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Pitch Prototype

Create a 2-minute prototype demo for a feature idea. Practice presenting it:
- To an engineer (focus on feasibility)
- To a PM (focus on user value)
- To an executive (focus on impact)

### Exercise 2: Feedback Session

Share a prototype and gather feedback:
- Set clear expectations
- Ask specific questions
- Note all reactions

## Key Takeaways

Prototypes are primarily communication tools that must be tailored to their specific audience to effectively demonstrate vision and value. By setting clear expectations about fidelity and focusing on a specific research question, you can use interactive models to build strategic buy-in and alignment. Most importantly, remain open to feedback—especially when it challenges your original assumptions—as the ultimate goal is to uncover the best solution for the user.

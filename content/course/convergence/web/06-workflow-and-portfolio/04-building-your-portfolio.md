# Building Your Portfolio

> **Quick Summary:** Your portfolio is how you show what you can do. For Design Engineers, it needs to demonstrate both design sensibility and engineering skill.

## What You'll Learn

- What to include in a Design Engineer portfolio
- How to present projects effectively
- Portfolio formats and platforms
- Common mistakes to avoid

## What Makes a DE Portfolio Different

> *"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."* — Linus Torvalds

Design portfolios traditionally show process and visual outcomes, while engineering portfolios demonstrate code quality and system architecture. A Design Engineer's portfolio must do both, bridging the gap by showcasing visual design quality, interaction polish, technical implementation details, and the strategic thinking behind every decision.

## What to Include

### Live Projects
Prioritise deployed, interactive work that users can touch. This includes side projects, small experiments, client work (if permitted), and any open source contributions you have made.

### Case Studies
Select a few key projects for deep dives. Explain the problem and context, outline your design approach and technical decisions, and discuss the final outcome and what you learned from the process.

### Code Samples
Provide evidence of your engineering skill. Maintain a GitHub profile with active repositories, ensuring your code is clean and documented. Highlight component libraries and open source work.

### Writing (Optional but Powerful)
Writing demonstrates your thinking process. Consider including technical tutorials, articles explaining design rationale, or perspectives on industry trends.

## Presenting Projects Effectively

### Lead with the Work
Don't make visitors hunt for your content. Lead with a live demo whenever possible. If the project isn't live, use high-quality video to demonstrate interactions, or screenshots as a last resort.

### Tell the Story
Narrate the journey of the project. clearly state what problem you were solving, what constraints existed, the specific decisions you made (and why), and the final outcome.

### Show the Details
Highlight the specific skills of a Design Engineer: intricate micro-interactions, responsive behaviour across devices, accessibility considerations, and performance optimisations.

### Include the Code
Always link to the source code where possible. Highlight interesting component architecture, complex animation implementations, or your approach to state management.

## Portfolio Platforms

### Personal Site (Recommended)
Building your own site is the best way to prove your skills. It gives you a custom domain, full control over the design and code, and serves as a portfolio piece in itself.

### GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify
These platforms offer easy deployment options with free hosting, support for custom domains, and automatic deployments from your repository.

### Figma Sites / Layers / Notion
These are lower-friction options that are quick to set up and look professional, but they offer less differentiation and don't demonstrate your coding ability.

## Common Mistakes

### Too Much Work
Curate ruthlessly. 5 great projects > 20 okay ones.

### No Live Demos
Static screenshots don't show interaction. Deploy your work.

### Missing Context
Beautiful work without explanation leaves questions unanswered.

### Outdated Work
If you've grown, show current abilities.

### No Clear CTA
What do you want visitors to do? Contact you? Hire you? Make it clear.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Audit

If you have a portfolio, audit it:
- Does it show both design and engineering?
- Are there live demos?
- Is the story clear?

### Exercise 2: Plan

List 3-5 projects for your portfolio. For each:
- What does it demonstrate?
- How will you present it?
- What's missing?

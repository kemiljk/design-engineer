# Finding DE Roles

> **Quick Summary:** Design Engineer roles are growing but still relatively rare. Learn how to find them, and how to create them where they don't exist.

## What You'll Learn

- Where DE roles exist
- Job titles to look for
- Making the case for DE roles
- Interview preparation

## Where DE Roles Exist

Check out [designengineer.io](https://designengineer.io/) for a curated job board dedicated to Design Engineer roles.

### Companies with DE Roles
Design Engineer roles are most common at product companies that maintain sophisticated design systems, design-forward startups that value polish, agencies known for high-end creative work, and large companies with dedicated prototyping or "creative technology" teams.

### Industries
You will frequently find these roles in the tech sector (especially B2C), finance (particularly modern trading platforms and fintech), media and entertainment, and high-end e-commerce.

### Team Structures
DEs typically sit within design systems teams, product teams with a heavy design focus, creative technology groups, or platform infrastructure teams.

## Job Titles to Watch For

The role goes by many names. You might see it listed as Design Engineer, UI Engineer, Frontend Designer, Creative Developer, Design Technologist, UX Engineer, or even Product Designer (with technical requirements) or Frontend Engineer (with styling focus). Always read the description rather than relying on the title alone.

Read descriptions, not just titles.

## What to Look For

### Good Signs
Look for job descriptions that mention design systems, prototyping responsibilities, and a focus on animation or motion. It's a positive sign if cross-functional collaboration is emphasized and if proficiency in both Figma and code is required.

### Warning Signs
Be wary of roles with heavy backend requirements, no mention of design collaboration, or descriptions that sound like pure "pixel pushing" within a siloed team structure.

## Making the Case

Sometimes the role doesn't exist yet. Create it:

### To Your Current Company
Start the conversation by demonstrating your unique value: "I can do both design and development. Let me show you the value of working across both."

### Building Evidence
Ship work that clearly demonstrates Design Engineering value. Document the impact of your contributions, show how you reduced handoff friction, and quantify the time saved for both designers and engineers.

### The Pitch
Identify specific pain points you can solve, and propose a trial period to prove the value. Focus on delivering quick wins to build trust, and then gradually expand your scope.

## Interview Preparation

### Portfolio Review
Have 2-3 key projects ready to discuss in depth. Practice explaining your decisions and be prepared to answer the "why" behind them, showing both your design thinking and code implementation.

### Technical Assessment
Assessments often include CSS layout challenges, animation implementation tasks, component building exercises, and questions about design system thinking.

### Design Questions
Be ready to answer questions like "How would you approach this problem?" or "Walk me through your design process." You should also be prepared to discuss how you handle design feedback.

### Cultural Fit
Interviewers will want to know how you work with designers, how you prioritise design fidelity versus development speed, and how you resolve conflicts when they arise.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Job Search

Search for DE-adjacent roles. Look beyond the title:
- What responsibilities overlap?
- What skills are required?
- What companies are hiring?

### Exercise 2: Pitch Preparation

Prepare a 2-minute pitch for why a company should hire a DE (or why your company should create the role).

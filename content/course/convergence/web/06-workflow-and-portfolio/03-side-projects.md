# Side Projects

> **Quick Summary:** Side projects are where Design Engineers grow fastest. No constraints, no stakeholders, just learning by building.

## What You'll Learn

- Why side projects accelerate growth
- Choosing the right projects
- Scoping for completion
- Turning projects into portfolio pieces

## Why Side Projects Matter

> *"Stay hungry, stay foolish."* — Stewart Brand

At work, you are often constrained by the existing tech stack, rigid team conventions, shifting business priorities, and tight timelines. Side projects, however, offer freedom. They allow you to explore new technologies, take creative risks without fear of failure, build exactly what interests you, and learn valuable lessons from mistakes in a safe environment.

## Choosing Projects

### Follow Curiosity
Ask yourself what you genuinely want to learn. If you're interested in new animation techniques, build something motion-heavy. If you want to improve your backend skills, build a full-stack app. If mobile development intrigues you, try building a React Native app.

### Solve Your Problems
Building tools for yourself is highly motivating. Create a task manager that works exactly how your brain does, a design tool for a specific workflow you find tedious, or a utility that saves you time in your daily life.

### Remake What You Love
Take something you admire and rebuild it to understand how it works. Recreate a complex interaction you love, build a specific feature from your favourite app, or improve upon a piece of software that has always frustrated you.

## Scoping for Completion

The graveyard of side projects is full of overscoped ideas.

The graveyard of side projects is full of overscoped ideas. To succeed, start tiny: don't set out to build a full app, build one feature. Don't build an entire design system, build one perfect component. Don't build a platform, build one page.

### Define "Done"
Before you write a single line of code, define your constraints. Write down exactly what "finished" looks like, list what is explicitly out of scope, and decide on a firm stopping point to prevent scope creep.

### Ship Early
Get your work online as soon as possible, even if it is imperfect. Use services like Vercel or Netlify for instant deployment, share the link with a few friends for feedback, and then be willing to move on to the next thing.

## Learning in Public

### Benefits of Sharing
Sharing your work creates accountability to finish and invites valuable feedback from others. It also builds your portfolio and expands your professional network.

### Where and What to Share
Different platforms serve different purposes. Use Twitter/X for quick visual updates, write blog posts for technical deep dives, publish source code to GitHub, and use CodePen for isolated experiments. Share your work in progress, the lessons you've learned, your failures and pivots, and the behind-the-scenes process.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Project Ideation

List 10 side project ideas. For each:
- What would you learn?
- How long would it take?
- What does "done" look like?

### Exercise 2: Minimum Viable Project

Take your most exciting idea. Scope it down to something you could finish this weekend.

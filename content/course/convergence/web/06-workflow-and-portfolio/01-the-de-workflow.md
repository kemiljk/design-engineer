# The DE Workflow

> **Quick Summary:** Design Engineers work across the entire product development cycle. Learn how to maximize your impact at each stage.

## What You'll Learn

- Where DEs fit in product development
- End-to-end ownership
- Working with designers and engineers
- Maximizing your unique position

## The Design Engineer Position

Design Engineers sit at the intersection:

You're not just a translator—you're a participant in both worlds.

## Stages of Involvement

### Discovery & Ideation
- **Contribution:** Technical feasibility, interaction ideas
- **Activities:** Brainstorming, rapid prototypes, technical constraints
- **Value:** Ground ideas in what's possible

### Design
- **Contribution:** Interactive prototypes, implementation considerations
- **Activities:** Prototype animations, test interactions, review specs
- **Value:** Find issues before development

### Development
- **Contribution:** Component implementation, design fidelity, polish
- **Activities:** Build UI, review for design accuracy, add micro-interactions
- **Value:** Ship design as intended

### Launch & Iteration
- **Contribution:** Performance optimisation, user feedback response
- **Activities:** Monitor, iterate, polish based on real usage
- **Value:** Continuous improvement

## End-to-End Ownership

The DE superpower is owning features from concept to polish:

1. Participate in design discussions
2. Build prototypes to validate ideas
3. Implement the production UI
4. Polish until it feels right
5. Iterate based on feedback

This reduces handoff friction and improves quality.

## Working with Designers

### What Designers Need from You
- Technical perspective (not limitations)
- Prototype capabilities
- Implementation partnership
- Design system stewardship

### Building Trust
- Respect their expertise
- Explain constraints constructively
- Collaborate, don't gate-keep
- Deliver on design intent

## Working with Engineers

### What Engineers Need from You
- Clear, implementable specs
- Component architecture guidance
- Animation implementation details
- Performance considerations

### Building Trust
- Write quality code
- Understand their constraints
- Don't over-engineer visuals
- Be pragmatic about trade-offs

## Daily Practices

- **Morning:** Check design files for updates, review PRs
- **Coding time:** Deep work on components, features
- **Collaboration:** Design reviews, pair programming
- **End of day:** Document decisions, update tickets

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Workflow Map

Map your current workflow. Where do you contribute? Where could you contribute more?

### Exercise 2: Relationship Audit

List your key collaborators. How can you provide more value to each?

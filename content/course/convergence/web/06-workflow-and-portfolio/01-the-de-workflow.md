# The DE Workflow

> **Quick Summary:** Design Engineers work across the entire product development cycle. Learn how to maximize your impact at each stage.

## What You'll Learn

- Where DEs fit in product development
- End-to-end ownership
- Working with designers and engineers
- Maximizing your unique position

## The Design Engineer Position

Design Engineers sit at the intersection:

You're not just a translator—you're a participant in both worlds.

## Stages of Involvement

### Discovery & Ideation
During the early discovery phase, your primary contribution is assessing technical feasibility and generating interaction ideas. You actively participate in brainstorming sessions, build rapid prototypes to test hypotheses, and identify technical constraints early, providing value by grounding wild ideas in what is actually possible.

### Design
In the design phase, you shift focus to creating interactive prototypes and identifying implementation considerations. Your key activities include animating prototypes, testing complex interactions, and reviewing specifications, which provides immense value by catching potential issues before development even begins.

### Development
When development starts, you take charge of component implementation, ensuring high design fidelity and adding final polish. You build the actual UI, review implemented screens for design accuracy, and add those critical micro-interactions, ensuring the final product ships exactly as the design intended.

### Launch & Iteration
Post-launch, you focus on performance optimisation and responding to user feedback. You monitor the live application, iterate on features based on real usage data, and add additional polish, driving continuous improvement of the product experience.

## End-to-End Ownership

The DE superpower is owning features from concept to polish:

The true superpower of a Design Engineer is the ability to own a feature from the initial concept all the way to the final polish. This means you participate in early design discussions, build validation prototypes, implement the production-ready UI yourself, polish it until it feels perfect, and then iterate based on user feedback.

This reduces handoff friction and improves quality.

## Working with Designers

### What Designers Need from You
Designers look to you for a technical perspective that empowers rather than limits them. They need you to demonstrate prototype capabilities that bring their static ideas to life, partner with them on implementation details, and act as a steward for the design system they have created.

### Building Trust
Trust is built by respecting their domain expertise and explaining technical constraints constructively, rather than just saying "no." Collaborate openly instead of gate-keeping the code, and most importantly, consistently deliver on the design intent they have specified.

## Working with Engineers

### What Engineers Need from You
Engineers rely on you to provide clear, implementable specifications and guidance on component architecture. They need detailed instructions on how animations should behave and consideration for performance impacts, ensuring that the visual flair doesn't compromise the application's speed.

### Building Trust
You build trust with engineers by writing high-quality, maintainable code and demonstrating that you understand their technical constraints. Avoid over-engineering visual effects where simple solutions suffice, and be pragmatic about trade-offs when deadlines are tight.

## Daily Practices

A typical day involves a mix of disciplines. You might start your morning by checking design files for updates and reviewing pull requests. The bulk of your day is often spent in deep work coding components or features, punctuated by collaboration sessions like design reviews or pair programming. Finally, you wrap up by documenting key decisions and updating ticket status.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Workflow Map

Map your current workflow. Where do you contribute? Where could you contribute more?

### Exercise 2: Relationship Audit

List your key collaborators. How can you provide more value to each?

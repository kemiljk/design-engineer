# Capstone Project: Design Engineer Portfolio Piece

> **Quick Summary:** Synthesise everything from the Web Convergence Track into a polished, portfolio-ready project that demonstrates your motion design, accessibility, performance, and design engineering workflow skills.

## What You'll Learn

- How to synthesise motion design, accessibility, and performance in one project
- Creating purposeful animations and micro-interactions
- Building accessibility-first experiences
- Optimising for performance and fast load times
- Documenting design-to-code decisions in a case study

## Why This Project?

A design engineer portfolio piece demonstrates the unique intersection of design and engineering. It showcases your **motion design sensibility** through purposeful animations, your **accessibility-first thinking** by being inclusive by default, your **performance awareness** through fast load times, and your **ability to ship** polished, production-ready work. Ultimately, it proves your **design-to-code fluency** and seamless translation between disciplines.

**Total Time Estimate:** 15-20 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you will have built a **interactive experience** that is polished and responsive. It will demonstrate **accessibility excellence** by strictly adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The project will be **performance optimised** to ensure fast load times and 60fps animations. You will also create a detailed **case study** documenting your decisions and publish a **live deployment** with a public GitHub repository.

## Choose Your Project

Select one of these project types, or propose your own:

### Option A: Interactive Product Landing Page
A marketing page with sophisticated interactions, scroll reveals, and micro-interactions.

### Option B: Interactive Data Visualisation
A storytelling experience with animated charts and scroll-driven narrative.

### Option C: Portfolio/Case Study Site
Your own design engineering portfolio with smooth transitions and interactive elements.

### Option D: Interactive Tool or Utility
A useful web tool with delightful interactions (e.g., colour palette generator, design token converter).

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Concept & Design](./02-capstone-concept.md) | Project brief, motion inventory, accessibility planning | 3-4 hours |
| [2. Foundation & Structure](./03-capstone-foundation.md) | Semantic HTML, CSS architecture, JS utilities | 3-4 hours |
| [3. Interactions & Motion](./04-capstone-motion.md) | Entrance animations, scroll reveals, micro-interactions | 4-5 hours |
| [4. Performance](./05-capstone-performance.md) | Image optimisation, CSS/JS optimisation, measurement | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Documentation & Deployment](./06-capstone-deployment.md) | Case study, README, deploy, final testing | 3-4 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Motion Design** | Basic animations | Purposeful, polished motion | Delightful, cohesive motion language |
| **Accessibility** | Some consideration | WCAG compliant, keyboard works | Exemplary, exceeds requirements |
| **Performance** | Page loads | Optimised, good scores | Lightning fast, all vitals green |
| **Code Quality** | Works but messy | Clean, organised | Elegant, well-documented |
| **Polish** | Functional | Professional quality | Portfolio-worthy, inspiring |
| **Case Study** | Brief explanation | Clear documentation | Compelling narrative |

## Inspiration

Study these portfolio pieces and case studies:

**Design Engineer Portfolios:** Stripe.com, Linear.app, Vercel.com

**Case Studies:** Airbnb Design, Spotify Design, Dropbox Design

## Tips for Success

1. **Scope appropriately** — Better to polish a smaller project than rush a large one
2. **Motion with purpose** — Every animation should serve a goal
3. **Test early** — Don't leave accessibility testing for the end
4. **Document as you go** — Take screenshots and notes throughout
5. **Get feedback** — Share with peers before finalising
6. **Own your narrative** — Your case study tells your story

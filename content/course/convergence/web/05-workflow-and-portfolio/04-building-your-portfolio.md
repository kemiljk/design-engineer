# Building Your Portfolio

> **Quick Summary:** Your portfolio is how you show what you can do. For Design Engineers, it needs to demonstrate both design sensibility and engineering skill.

## What You'll Learn

- What to include in a DE portfolio
- How to present projects effectively
- Portfolio formats and platforms
- Common mistakes to avoid

## What Makes a DE Portfolio Different

> *"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."* — Linus Torvalds

Design portfolios show process and outcomes.
Engineering portfolios show code and systems.

DE portfolios show both—plus the bridge between them:
- Visual design quality
- Interaction polish
- Technical implementation
- The thinking behind decisions

## What to Include

### Live Projects
Deployed, interactive work:
- Side projects
- Experiments
- Client work (if allowed)
- Open source contributions

### Case Studies
Deeper dives into select projects:
- The problem and context
- Your design approach
- Technical decisions
- Outcome and learnings

### Code Samples
Evidence of engineering skill:
- GitHub profile with active repos
- Clean, documented code
- Component libraries
- Open source work

### Writing (Optional but Powerful)
Demonstrates thinking:
- Technical tutorials
- Design rationale articles
- Industry perspectives

## Presenting Projects Effectively

### Lead with the Work
Don't make people hunt:
- Live demo first
- Video if interaction matters
- Screenshots if necessary

### Tell the Story
- What problem were you solving?
- What constraints existed?
- What decisions did you make and why?
- What was the outcome?

### Show the Details
DE-specific things to highlight:
- Micro-interactions
- Responsive behaviour
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimizations

### Include the Code
Link to the source:
- Component architecture
- Animation implementation
- State management approach

## Portfolio Platforms

### Personal Site (Recommended)
Build it yourself to show your skills:
- Custom domain
- Your own design
- Your own code
- Full control

### GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify
Easy deployment options:
- Free hosting
- Custom domains
- Automatic deploys

### Read.cv / Layers / Notion
Lower friction options:
- Quick to set up
- Professional appearance
- Less differentiation

## Common Mistakes

### Too Much Work
Curate ruthlessly. 5 great projects > 20 okay ones.

### No Live Demos
Static screenshots don't show interaction. Deploy your work.

### Missing Context
Beautiful work without explanation leaves questions unanswered.

### Outdated Work
If you've grown, show current abilities.

### No Clear CTA
What do you want visitors to do? Contact you? Hire you? Make it clear.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Audit

If you have a portfolio, audit it:
- Does it show both design and engineering?
- Are there live demos?
- Is the story clear?

### Exercise 2: Plan

List 3-5 projects for your portfolio. For each:
- What does it demonstrate?
- How will you present it?
- What's missing?

# Bridging Design and Engineering

> **Quick Summary:** The gap between design and engineering causes friction, delays, and quality issues. Design Engineers can bridge this gap.

## What You'll Learn

- Common friction points
- Communication strategies
- Building shared understanding
- Being an effective bridge

## The Gap

> *"The best designers understand technology and the best technologists understand design."* — John Maeda

Common problems when design and engineering are siloed:
- "That's not what I designed"
- "That's technically impossible"
- "We didn't know about this constraint"
- "Why does this feel different?"

These problems waste time and hurt quality.

## Where Friction Happens

### Design → Engineering Handoff
- Missing states in designs
- Unclear interaction specifications
- Unrealistic timelines
- Technical constraints discovered late

### Engineering → Design Feedback
- Changes needed for technical reasons
- Performance trade-offs
- Platform limitations
- Edge cases discovered during implementation

## Communication Strategies

### Be in Both Channels
- Join design critiques
- Attend engineering standups
- Be in both Slack channels
- Cross-pollinate context

### Translate, Don't Just Relay
Don't just pass messages—translate:
- Designer: "It should feel bouncy"
- To Engineer: "We need a spring animation with 0.8 damping ratio"

### Surface Issues Early
See a problem coming? Raise it before it's costly:
- "This parallax effect will be hard to make performant"
- "This layout won't work well on these screen sizes"

## Building Shared Understanding

### Shared Vocabulary
Establish terms both sides understand:
- Component names
- State names
- Animation descriptions
- Breakpoint names

### Living Documentation
Maintain artifacts both sides reference:
- Design system documentation
- Component libraries with visual examples
- Animation libraries
- Pattern libraries

### Joint Sessions
Bring teams together:
- Design reviews with engineers
- Technical feasibility discussions with designers
- Retrospectives including both

## Being an Effective Bridge

### Don't Pick Sides
You're not design's advocate OR engineering's advocate—you're the product's advocate.

### Be Constructive
"That won't work" → "That's tricky because X. What if we tried Y?"

### Build Relationships
People listen to those they trust. Invest in relationships on both sides.

### Know When to Step Back
Not every issue needs a bridge. Sometimes let teams work directly.

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Gap Analysis

Identify the three biggest friction points between design and engineering at your company. What could you do about each?

### Exercise 2: Translation Practice

Take a design spec and translate it to engineering requirements. Take engineering constraints and explain them in design terms.

## Key Takeaways

- The design-engineering gap causes real problems
- Be present in both worlds
- Translate context, don't just relay messages
- Build shared vocabulary and documentation
- Advocate for the product, not a team

# Finding DE Roles

> **Quick Summary:** Design Engineer roles are growing but still relatively rare. Learn how to find them, and how to create them where they don't exist.

## What You'll Learn

- Where DE roles exist
- Job titles to look for
- Making the case for DE roles
- Interview preparation

## Where DE Roles Exist

### Companies with DE Roles
- Product companies with design systems
- Design-forward startups
- Agencies doing high-end work
- Companies with dedicated prototyping teams

### Industries
- Tech (especially B2C)
- Finance (trading platforms, fintech)
- Media and entertainment
- E-commerce

### Team Structures
- Design systems teams
- Product teams with design focus
- Creative technology teams
- Platform/infrastructure teams

## Job Titles to Watch For

The role has many names:
- Design Engineer
- UI Engineer
- Frontend Designer
- Creative Developer
- Design Technologist
- UX Engineer
- Product Designer (with technical focus)
- Frontend Engineer (design systems)

Read descriptions, not just titles.

## What to Look For

### Good Signs
- Design systems mentioned
- Prototyping responsibilities
- Animation/motion focus
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Both Figma and code in requirements

### Warning Signs
- Heavy backend requirements
- No mention of design collaboration
- Pure pixel pushing
- Siloed team structure

## Making the Case

Sometimes the role doesn't exist yet. Create it:

### To Your Current Company
"I can do both design and development. Let me show you the value of working across both."

### Building Evidence
- Ship work that demonstrates DE value
- Document the impact
- Show reduced handoff friction
- Quantify time saved

### The Pitch
- Identify pain points you can solve
- Propose a trial period
- Deliver quick wins
- Expand scope gradually

## Interview Preparation

### Portfolio Review
- Have 2-3 projects ready to discuss in depth
- Practice explaining decisions
- Prepare for "why" questions
- Show both design and code

### Technical Assessment
Likely to include:
- CSS layout challenges
- Animation implementation
- Component building
- Design system thinking

### Design Questions
- How would you approach X problem?
- Walk me through your design process
- How do you handle design feedback?

### Cultural Fit
- How do you work with designers?
- How do you prioritize fidelity vs. speed?
- Tell me about a conflict you resolved

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Job Search

Search for DE-adjacent roles. Look beyond the title:
- What responsibilities overlap?
- What skills are required?
- What companies are hiring?

### Exercise 2: Pitch Preparation

Prepare a 2-minute pitch for why a company should hire a DE (or why your company should create the role).

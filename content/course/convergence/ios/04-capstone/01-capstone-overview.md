# Capstone Project: Polished iOS Experience

> **Quick Summary:** Synthesise everything from the iOS Convergence Track into a polished, portfolio-ready iOS app or feature that demonstrates your animation, prototyping, and accessibility skills.

## Why This Project?

A polished iOS app demonstrates design engineering excellence:

- **SwiftUI animation mastery** — Sophisticated, purposeful motion
- **Accessibility-first implementation** — VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, reduced motion
- **Attention to detail and craft** — Professional-quality polish
- **Ability to ship** — Production-ready work
- **Design engineering sensibility** — Bridging design and code

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have:

1. **Polished iOS App or Feature** — Sophisticated animations and delightful micro-interactions
2. **Accessibility Excellence** — Full VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and reduced motion support
3. **Professional Polish** — Refined visual details, smooth performance, graceful error handling
4. **Case Study** — Animation decisions documented and technical challenges explained
5. **Deliverables** — Working Xcode project, screen recordings, GitHub repository

## Choose Your Project

Select one of these project approaches:

### Option A: Enhance an Existing App
Take your Engineering Track capstone and add polish with animations and accessibility.

### Option B: Build a Focused Feature
Create a single, highly polished feature like an onboarding flow or settings screen.

### Option C: Interactive Prototype
Build a high-fidelity prototype for a concept with 3-5 fully animated screens.

### Option D: Widget or Extension
Create a polished Home Screen widget with multiple sizes and excellent accessibility.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Planning & Audit](./02-capstone-planning.md) | Define scope, motion plan, accessibility audit | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Animation Implementation](./03-capstone-animation.md) | View transitions, component animations, custom transitions | 3-4 hours |
| [3. Accessibility Implementation](./04-capstone-accessibility.md) | VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, reduced motion | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Polish & Details](./05-capstone-polish.md) | Loading states, empty states, error handling, haptics | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Documentation & Delivery](./06-capstone-delivery.md) | Screen recordings, case study, README | 2-3 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Animation Quality** | Basic animations | Polished, purposeful | Delightful, cohesive system |
| **Accessibility** | Partial support | Full compliance | Exemplary implementation |
| **Polish** | Functional states | Professional quality | Exceptional attention to detail |
| **Code Quality** | Works | Clean, organised | Elegant, well-structured |
| **Documentation** | Basic README | Clear case study | Compelling portfolio piece |

## Tips for Success

1. **Less is more** — A few excellent animations beat many mediocre ones
2. **Test constantly** — Enable VoiceOver and reduced motion while developing
3. **Record everything** — Capture your animations for the case study
4. **Seek feedback** — Test with real users if possible
5. **Document decisions** — Explain *why*, not just *what*

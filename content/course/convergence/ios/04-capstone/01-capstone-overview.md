# Capstone Project: Polished iOS Experience

> **Quick Summary:** Synthesise everything from the iOS Convergence Track into a polished, portfolio-ready iOS app or feature that demonstrates your animation, prototyping, and accessibility skills.

## What You'll Learn

- How to synthesise swiftui animation mastery in a complete project
- Creating accessibility-first implementations with voiceover and dynamic type
- Applying attention to detail and craft to achieve professional polish
- Documenting animation decisions in a comprehensive case study

## Why This Project?

A polished iOS app demonstrates design engineering excellence by showcasing **SwiftUI animation mastery** through sophisticated, purposeful motion. It requires an **accessibility-first implementation** supporting VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and reduced motion. The final result proves your **attention to detail and craft**, your **ability to ship** production-ready work, and your unique **design engineering sensibility** that bridges the gap between design and code.

**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you will have a **polished iOS app or feature** filled with sophisticated animations and delightful micro-interactions. You will demonstrate **accessibility excellence** with full VoiceOver and Dynamic Type support, and achieve **professional polish** through refined visual details. Your work will be documented in a comprehensive **case study** explaining your animation decisions, and you will produce final **deliverables** including a working Xcode project, screen recordings, and a GitHub repository.

## Choose Your Project

Select one of these project approaches:

### Option A: Enhance an Existing App
Take your Engineering Track capstone and add polish with animations and accessibility.

### Option B: Build a Focused Feature
Create a single, highly polished feature like an onboarding flow or settings screen.

### Option C: Interactive Prototype
Build a high-fidelity prototype for a concept with 3-5 fully animated screens.

### Option D: Widget or Extension
Create a polished Home Screen widget with multiple sizes and excellent accessibility.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Planning & Audit](./02-capstone-planning.md) | Define scope, motion plan, accessibility audit | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Animation Implementation](./03-capstone-animation.md) | View transitions, component animations, custom transitions | 3-4 hours |
| [3. Accessibility Implementation](./04-capstone-accessibility.md) | VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, reduced motion | 2-3 hours |
| [4. Polish & Details](./05-capstone-polish.md) | Loading states, empty states, error handling, haptics | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Documentation & Delivery](./06-capstone-delivery.md) | Screen recordings, case study, README | 2-3 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work throughout the project:

| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Excellent |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Animation Quality** | Basic animations | Polished, purposeful | Delightful, cohesive system |
| **Accessibility** | Partial support | Full compliance | Exemplary implementation |
| **Polish** | Functional states | Professional quality | Exceptional attention to detail |
| **Code Quality** | Works | Clean, organised | Elegant, well-structured |
| **Documentation** | Basic README | Clear case study | Compelling portfolio piece |

## Tips for Success

**Less is more**—a few excellent animations beat many mediocre ones. **Test constantly** by enabling VoiceOver and reduced motion settings while you develop. **Record everything** as you go to capture high-quality assets for your case study. **Seek feedback** by testing with real users if possible, and always **document your decisions** by explaining the *why* behind your choices, not just the *what*.

# Capstone Project: Polished Android Experience

> **Quick Summary:** Build a portfolio-ready Android app or feature that demonstrates mastery of motion design, accessibility, and the complete design-to-code workflow.

## Why This Project?

A polished Android experience showcases design engineering excellence:

- **Fluid Animations** — Meaningful motion that enhances usability
- **Full Accessibility** — TalkBack support and inclusive design
- **Performance Excellence** — 60fps animations and optimised rendering
- **Design-Code Convergence** — Seamless translation from design to implementation

**Total Time Estimate:** 12-16 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you'll have a polished Android experience that showcases:

- Compose animation mastery
- Material motion implementation
- Full TalkBack support
- Performance optimisation
- Case study documentation

## Choose Your Project

Select one project that demonstrates convergence skills:

### Option A: Onboarding Experience
A 3-5 screen onboarding flow with page transitions, animated illustrations, and accessibility announcements.

### Option B: Interactive Dashboard
A data dashboard with animated charts, pull-to-refresh, staggered list animations, and screen reader-friendly data.

### Option C: Media Player
A music or podcast player with expandable mini-player animation, gesture-driven controls, and media accessibility.

### Option D: Social Feed
A content feed with shared element transitions, reaction animations, and accessible content descriptions.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Planning & Audit](./02-capstone-planning.md) | Project selection, motion audit, accessibility audit | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Animation Implementation](./03-capstone-animation.md) | Core animations, transitions, gestures | 4-5 hours |
| [3. Accessibility Implementation](./04-capstone-accessibility.md) | Semantics, focus management, live regions | 3-4 hours |
| [4. Polish & Details](./05-capstone-polish.md) | Performance, haptics, edge cases | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Documentation & Delivery](./06-capstone-delivery.md) | Code docs, case study, repository | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work:

### Animation Quality (30%)
- Purposeful motion that enhances UX
- Smooth performance (60fps)
- Appropriate timing and easing
- Cohesive motion design language

### Accessibility (30%)
- Complete TalkBack navigation
- Proper semantic structure
- Alternative interaction methods
- Inclusive design decisions

### Code Quality (25%)
- Clean Compose patterns
- Efficient state management
- Performance optimisation
- Proper architecture

### Polish & Documentation (15%)
- Attention to detail
- Edge case handling
- Clear documentation
- Portfolio presentation

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple** — Get basic functionality working before adding animation polish
2. **Profile Early** — Use Android Studio Profiler to catch performance issues
3. **Test on Device** — Animations feel different on real hardware
4. **Use TalkBack Throughout** — Don't save accessibility testing for the end
5. **Record Everything** — Capture animations for your portfolio
6. **Respect User Preferences** — Honour reduced motion and font size settings

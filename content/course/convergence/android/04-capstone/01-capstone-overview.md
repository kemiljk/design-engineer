# Capstone Project: Polished Android Experience

> **Quick Summary:** Build a portfolio-ready Android app or feature that demonstrates mastery of motion design, accessibility, and the complete design-to-code workflow.

## What You'll Learn

- How to demonstrate Compose animation mastery and Material motion
- Creating full TalkBack support for accessibility
- Optimising for performance and 60fps rendering
- Executing a seamless design-code convergence workflow

## Why This Project?

A polished Android experience showcases design engineering excellence by combining **fluid animations** that enhance usability with **full accessibility** support for TalkBack. It demonstrates **performance excellence** through 60fps rendering and proves your ability to execute a seamless **design-code convergence** workflow.

**Total Time Estimate:** 12-16 hours across all phases

## What You'll Create

By the end of this capstone, you will have created a polished Android experience that demonstrates **Compose animation mastery** and robust **Material motion implementation**. The project will feature **full TalkBack support**, evidence of **performance optimisation**, and will be accompanied by comprehensive **case study documentation**.

## Choose Your Project

Select one project that demonstrates convergence skills:

### Option A: Onboarding Experience
A 3-5 screen onboarding flow with page transitions, animated illustrations, and accessibility announcements.

### Option B: Interactive Dashboard
A data dashboard with animated charts, pull-to-refresh, staggered list animations, and screen reader-friendly data.

### Option C: Media Player
A music or podcast player with expandable mini-player animation, gesture-driven controls, and media accessibility.

### Option D: Social Feed
A content feed with shared element transitions, reaction animations, and accessible content descriptions.

## The Phases

This capstone is broken into five focused phases:

| Phase | Focus | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| [1. Planning & Audit](./02-capstone-planning.md) | Project selection, motion audit, accessibility audit | 2-3 hours |
| [2. Animation Implementation](./03-capstone-animation.md) | Core animations, transitions, gestures | 4-5 hours |
| [3. Accessibility Implementation](./04-capstone-accessibility.md) | Semantics, focus management, live regions | 3-4 hours |
| [4. Polish & Details](./05-capstone-polish.md) | Performance, haptics, edge cases | 2-3 hours |
| [5. Documentation & Delivery](./06-capstone-delivery.md) | Code docs, case study, repository | 1-2 hours |

## Self-Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to assess your own work:

### Animation Quality (30%)
Your animations should provide **purposeful motion** that enhances the user experience, rather than just adding flair. They must maintain smooth **60fps performance** with appropriate **timing and easing**, resulting in a cohesive motion design language.

### Accessibility (30%)
The app must support complete **TalkBack navigation** with a proper **semantic structure**. You should implement **alternative interaction methods** and demonstrate inclusive design decisions throughout.

### Code Quality (25%)
The codebase should utilise clean **Compose patterns** and efficient **state management**. It requires clear evidence of **performance optimisation** and a proper, scalable **architecture**.

### Polish & Documentation (15%)
Success requires visible attention to **detail**, robust **edge case handling**, clear **documentation**, and a professional **portfolio presentation**.

## Tips for Success

**Start simple** by getting basic functionality working before adding animation polish. **Profile early** using the Android Studio Profiler to catch performance issues before they compound. Always **test on device** as animations often feel different on real hardware compared to emulators. **Use TalkBack throughout** the process rather than saving accessibility testing for the end. **Record everything** to capture high-quality assets for your portfolio, and always **respect user preferences** by honouring settings for reduced motion and font sizes.

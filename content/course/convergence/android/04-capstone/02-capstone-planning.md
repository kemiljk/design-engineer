# Capstone: Planning & Audit

> **Quick Summary:** Select your project, plan your animation strategy, and define your accessibility approach.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

This phase focuses on defining a clear **project scope** to prevent feature creep. You will create a comprehensive **animation strategy** and perform an initial **audit for accessibility** requirements to guide your development.

## Step 1: Project Selection

Document your project scope:

```kotlin
/*
Project: [Your Choice]
Core Feature: [Main interaction]
Animation Goals:
  - [Animation 1]
  - [Animation 2]
  - [Animation 3]
Accessibility Goals:
  - [A11y goal 1]
  - [A11y goal 2]
*/
```

## Step 2: Motion Audit

Plan your animation strategy:

Plan your animation strategy by defining how elements appear on screen (**entrances**) and how different screens connect through **transitions**. Determine how interactions will provide **feedback** to the user and how **state changes** (like loading or success) will be communicated visually.

## Step 3: Accessibility Audit

Define your accessibility approach:

Define your accessibility approach upfront. Ensure you have planned **content descriptions** for all interactive elements and established a logical **focus order** and navigation pattern. Verify that all interactive elements meet the minimum **touch target size** of 48dp, and check that your **colour contrast** and text scaling support meets required standards.

## Checkpoint

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] Project scope defined
- [ ] Animation strategy planned
- [ ] Accessibility approach documented
- [ ] Clear goals established

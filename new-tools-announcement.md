**Subject:** Six New Tools to Sharpen Your Craft

---

Hi there,

We've been building something for you.

Not more content to consume. Not more theory to memorise. **Tools**—the kind you actually use whilst working. The kind that eliminate the friction between idea and implementation.

## Why Tools?

Design engineering lives in the details. The spring curve that feels *just right*. The spacing scale that creates rhythm across every screen. The accessibility audit that catches what your eyes missed.

These aren't things you look up once and forget. They're the calculations you do repeatedly, the parameters you tweak constantly, the checks you run before every handoff.

So we built tools for them. Six of them.

## What's New:

### Spring Physics Playground
Drag sliders. Watch the ball bounce. Copy the code. That's it.

Whether you're targeting Framer Motion, CSS, or SwiftUI, this playground lets you experiment with mass, stiffness, and damping until the animation *feels* right. No more guessing spring parameters—see them, tweak them, export them.

### Easing Generator
For when springs are too much and linear is too little.

A visual cubic-bezier editor with draggable control points, real-time preview, and instant export. Load presets like ease-in-out or craft something entirely your own. The animation plays as you design it.

### Design Token Calculator
Start with a base size. Choose a scale ratio. Get a complete, harmonious type and spacing system.

Exports to Tailwind config, CSS variables, or SCSS maps. No more arbitrary values. No more "this looks about right." Just mathematical consistency across your entire design system.

### Aspect Ratio Calculator
Input width and height, get the ratio. Input width and ratio, get the height.

Simple, but necessary. Includes common presets (16:9, 4:3, 1:1) and generates the CSS you need for responsive media containers. The visual preview updates as you type.

### Accessibility Auditor *(Requires Sign-in)*
Paste your React or HTML code. Get an instant AI-powered audit.

It checks semantic structure, ARIA attributes, contrast ratios, and more. But here's the important bit: it doesn't just flag issues—it explains *why* they matter and suggests how to fix them. Educational output, not just error messages.

### Task Builder *(Requires Sign-in)*
Need practice? Generate customised design engineering challenges on demand.

Specify your skill level, focus areas, and constraints. The AI creates detailed task briefs—the kind you'd get in a real take-home assignment. Perfect for interview prep, portfolio building, or team training.

## The Philosophy

Every tool follows the same principle: **reduce the gap between thinking and making**.

No accounts required for most tools. No paywalls on the basics. Just utilities that respect your time and help you ship better work.

The AI-powered tools (Accessibility Auditor and Task Builder) require a free account—this helps us manage API costs whilst keeping everything accessible.

## What's Coming

These six are just the start. We're watching how you use them, listening to what you need, and building more.

If there's a tool you wish existed—something that would save you minutes every day—let us know. Reply to this email. We're building for you.

P.S. — All tools are free to use. The best way to support this work is to share it with someone who'd find it useful.

**Subject:** 12 Free Tools to Supercharge Your Design Engineering Workflow

---

Hi there,

We've been busy. *Really* busy.

What started as a handful of utilities has grown into something much bigger: a **complete toolkit for design engineers**—12 purpose-built tools that eliminate the friction between idea and implementation.

No more Googling formulas. No more context-switching between apps. No more "close enough" when you need precision.

Let's dive in.

## 🎬 Animation & Motion

### Spring Physics Playground
Drag sliders. Watch the ball bounce. Copy the code. That's it.

Whether you're targeting Framer Motion, CSS, SwiftUI, or Android, this playground lets you experiment with mass, stiffness, and damping until the animation *feels* right. See it, tweak it, ship it.

### Easing Generator
For when springs are too much and linear is too little.

A visual cubic-bezier editor with draggable control points and real-time preview. Load presets or craft something entirely your own—the animation plays as you design it.

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Gradient Generator ✨ NEW
Create stunning linear, radial, and conic gradients with full control over colour stops, angles, and positions.

Export to CSS, Tailwind, SwiftUI, or Android—all from one interface. The visual preview updates in real-time as you craft the perfect gradient.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/gradient-generator](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/gradient-generator)

### Shadow Generator ✨ NEW
Design layered, realistic shadows that bring depth to your interfaces.

Fine-tune blur, spread, offset, and opacity across multiple shadow layers. Export to CSS, Tailwind, SwiftUI, Android, or React Native with one click.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/shadow-generator](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/shadow-generator)

### Colour Converter ✨ NEW
Stop searching for colour conversion formulas.

Paste any colour in HEX, RGB, HSL, or OKLCH and instantly get values for every format you need—including SwiftUI and Android-specific colour formats. Copy and go.

### Aspect Ratio Calculator
Input width and height, get the ratio. Input width and ratio, get the height.

Simple, but essential. Includes common presets (16:9, 4:3, 1:1) and generates responsive CSS. The visual preview updates as you type.

## 🧱 Design Systems

### Token Calculator
Start with a base size. Choose a scale ratio. Get a complete, harmonious type and spacing system.

Exports to Tailwind v4, CSS variables, or SCSS maps. No more arbitrary values—just mathematical consistency across your entire design system.

## 📱 Mobile & Accessibility

### Touch Target Calculator ✨ NEW
Are your tap targets accessible? Find out instantly.

Input your element dimensions and get pass/fail validation against iOS Human Interface Guidelines, Material Design specs, and WCAG accessibility standards—all at once.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/touch-target](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/touch-target)

### App Icon Sizes ✨ NEW
Never hunt for icon dimensions again.

A complete reference guide for every app icon size you need—iOS, Android, macOS, and web. All the required dimensions, all in one place, always up to date.

## 🔧 Code & Development

### Framework Converter ✨ NEW
Building in React but need Svelte? Working across multiple frameworks?

Paste your component code and convert syntax between React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, and Solid. It's not magic—it's pattern matching that saves you hours of manual translation.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/framework-converter](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/framework-converter)

## 🤖 AI-Powered

### Accessibility Auditor *(Requires Sign-in)*
Paste your React or HTML code. Get an instant AI-powered audit.

It checks semantic structure, ARIA attributes, contrast ratios, and more. But here's the key: it doesn't just flag issues—it explains *why* they matter and shows you how to fix them.

→ [designengineer.xyz/tools/accessibility-auditor](https://designengineer.xyz/tools/accessibility-auditor)

### Task Builder *(Requires Sign-in)*
Need practice? Generate customised design engineering challenges on demand.

Specify your skill level, focus areas, and constraints. The AI creates detailed task briefs—the kind you'd get in a real take-home assignment. Perfect for interview prep, portfolio building, or team training.

## The Philosophy

Every tool follows the same principle: **reduce the gap between thinking and making**.

- ✅ No account required for most tools
- ✅ No paywalls on the basics
- ✅ Export to web *and* native platforms
- ✅ Built for real workflows, not demos

The AI-powered tools (Accessibility Auditor and Task Builder) require a free account to help us manage API costs whilst keeping everything accessible.

## We're Just Getting Started

Twelve tools live. More on the way.

If there's a tool you wish existed—something that would save you minutes every day—hit reply and tell us. We're building for you.

# I Built 12 Tools (And You Can Use Them All)

We just shipped 12 tools for design engineers.

Not toys. Not demos. Actual utilities I wish existed when I was constantly switching between apps, searching for conversion formulas, or eyeballing animation timing because "close enough" was faster than finding the right value.

## Why I built them

There's this moment in every project where you need something specific. A shadow that looks exactly right. A spring animation with the perfect bounce. An aspect ratio calculation you could do manually but shouldn't have to.

You could open another app. You could Google the formula. You could approximate it and move on.

Or you could have a tool that just does it.

That's what these are. Purpose-built utilities that eliminate the friction between thinking and making.

## The tools

I'm not going to list all twelve with feature bullets. You can see them yourself at [designengineer.xyz/tools](https://designengineer.xyz/tools). But here's what I use most:

**Spring Physics Playground** gets the most use. Drag sliders, watch the ball bounce, copy the code. Whether I'm working in Motion, CSS, SwiftUI, or Android, I can dial in mass, stiffness, and damping until it feels right. No guessing.

**Gradient Generator** saved me from writing CSS gradients by hand. Linear, radial, conic. Real-time preview. Export to CSS, Tailwind, SwiftUI, or Android. One interface, all platforms.

**Token Calculator** is what I wanted every time I started a new design system. Pick a base size and scale ratio, get a complete type and spacing system. Mathematical consistency instead of arbitrary values.

**Touch Target Calculator** tells me instantly if my tap targets meet iOS HIG, Material Design, and WCAG standards. All three at once. No more checking specs in three different places.

**Framework Converter** translates component code between React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, and Solid. Not magic. Pattern matching that saves hours of manual translation when you're working across frameworks.

The others solve equally specific problems. Colour conversion across formats. Shadow layering with precise control. Easing curves with visual feedback. App icon dimensions for every platform.

## The two AI tools

Two tools require a free account because they use AI and we need to manage API costs.

**Accessibility Auditor** takes your React or HTML code and gives you a proper audit. Semantic structure, ARIA attributes, contrast ratios. But it doesn't just flag issues. It explains why they matter and shows you how to fix them.

**Task Builder** generates design engineering challenges on demand. Specify your skill level and constraints, get a detailed brief. The kind you'd get in a real take-home assignment. I use it for interview prep ideas and portfolio projects.

## The philosophy

No paywalls on the basics. No account required for most tools. Export to web and native platforms. Built for real workflows.

These aren't marketing exercises. They're tools I use while building. The Gradient Generator is open in a tab right now. I used the Token Calculator when setting up the course design system. The Spring Playground sits permanently in my bookmarks.

## What's next

Twelve tools live. More coming.

If there's a specific utility you wish existed, something that would save you minutes every day, let me know. I'm building for practitioners, not pageviews.

All the tools are free. If you find them useful, share them with someone who would too.

# Course Details Follow-Up Email (Tuesday)

**Subject:** Inside the Design Engineer Course

---

Hi again,

Last week we showed you the new d×e platform. Today, let's talk about what you'll actually learn.

The Design Engineer Course isn't a collection of tutorials. It's a complete curriculum—structured like a university program, but built for practitioners who need to ship.

## How It's Structured

The course has three tracks that build on each other:

### Track 1: Design

This isn't "10 Figma Tips" or "Color Theory Basics." It's a complete foundation in visual design thinking.

**What you'll learn:**
- Visual design fundamentals—hierarchy, spacing, typography, color systems
- Platform-specific design patterns (iOS HIG, Material Design, web conventions)
- Design systems—from design tokens to component documentation
- How to think in systems, not just screens
- How to communicate design decisions to engineers

**Who it's for:**
- Engineers who want to stop guessing at spacing and color
- Designers who want to understand the principles behind their intuition
- Anyone building products who needs to make confident design decisions

The Design Track teaches you to see like a designer—to understand *why* something works, not just that it does.

### Track 2: Engineering

Learn to build for Web, iOS, or Android. Pick one platform or learn all three—the principles translate.

**Web Track:**
- HTML fundamentals and semantic structure
- CSS from basics to layout systems (Flexbox, Grid)
- JavaScript and modern component architecture
- React/Next.js for production applications

**iOS Track:**
- Swift fundamentals and language patterns
- SwiftUI from basics to complex interfaces
- State management and data flow
- Building production iOS apps

**Android Track:**
- Kotlin fundamentals and language features
- Jetpack Compose and modern Android UI
- State and composition patterns
- Building production Android apps

**What ties them together:**
Understanding how design decisions translate to code. How to evaluate technical feasibility. How to make implementation choices that serve the design.

### Track 3: Convergence

This is where design engineers separate from designers who can code or engineers who dabble in design.

**What you'll master:**
- Motion design—principles, timing, micro-interactions
- Prototyping—from concept to interactive prototype to production
- Accessibility—building inclusive experiences that work for everyone
- Performance and polish—the details that make work feel professional
- The complete DE workflow—bridging design and engineering in practice
- Portfolio building—showcasing your hybrid skillset

Convergence teaches you to work at the intersection. Not translating between disciplines, but thinking fluidly across both.

## How You'll Learn

Every lesson follows the same structure:
1. **Concept** — The principle or pattern you're learning
2. **Context** — Why it matters, when to use it
3. **Practice** — Hands-on exercises that build muscle memory
4. **Production** — Real examples from production applications

No fluff. No filler. Every lesson earns its place.

## What You'll Build

By the end of the course, you'll have:
- A component library you built from scratch
- Interactive prototypes that demonstrate motion design
- Production-ready applications for your chosen platform
- A portfolio that proves you can work across the entire product development lifecycle

These aren't throwaway exercises. They're portfolio pieces.

## Start Free

You don't need to take our word for it. The entire Introduction module and the first section of each track are completely free.

That's roughly 20 lessons—enough to understand what Design Engineering is, see our teaching style, and decide if this is right for you.

No credit card. No trial period that converts to paid. Just free.

## Who This Is For

This course welcomes two types of people:

**Designers learning to build** — You have the eye but rely on engineers to implement your ideas. You want to prototype in code, understand technical constraints, and ship side projects independently.

**Engineers developing design taste** — You can build anything but it looks... functional. You want to develop visual judgment, understand design principles, and create polished work without designer oversight.

If you're somewhere in between, even better.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a bootcamp promising you'll be job-ready in 6 weeks. Design Engineering is a craft that takes time to develop.

This isn't a tips-and-tricks course. We're not teaching shortcuts—we're teaching fundamentals that compound.

This isn't passive learning. Every lesson has exercises. If you don't build as you learn, you won't get the value.

## The Standard

We're holding the course to the same standard as the platform. Every lesson is edited for clarity. Every example is production-quality. Every exercise is designed to build on what came before.

Precision. Purpose. Craft.

If you've been waiting for a comprehensive Design Engineer curriculum, this is it.

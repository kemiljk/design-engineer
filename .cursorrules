### Examples

#### Good (British English)
```tsx
<h1>Customise Your Learning Experience</h1>
<p>Whilst learning to code, you'll realise that design and engineering are deeply connected.</p>
<Button>Optimise Your Workflow</Button>
```

#### Bad (Mixed)
```tsx
<h1>Customize Your Learning Experience</h1>
<p>While learning to code, you'll realize that design and engineering are deeply connected.</p>
<Button>Optimize Your Workflow</Button>
```

#### Code is Still American
```css
/* Correct - CSS uses American English */
.button {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: gray;
}
```

```tsx
// Correct - Code uses American English
const backgroundColor = "gray";
function centerElement() {
  // British English in comments explaining to users
  // This function centres the element on the page
  element.style.textAlign = "center"; // American in code
}
```

### Grammar Differences

**Collective nouns:**
- British: "The team are working" (plural)
- American: "The team is working" (singular)
- **Use British style**

**Quotation marks:**
- British: Single quotes for speech, punctuation outside: 'Hello', he said.
- American: Double quotes, punctuation inside: "Hello," he said.
- **Use British style for prose**

**Date format:**
- British: 21 December 2025
- American: December 21, 2025
- **Use British style**

**Prepositions:**
- British: "at the weekend"
- American: "on the weekend"
- **Use British style**

### Currency
- Use £ (GBP) as primary currency
- Format: £199 (no space)
- Spelled out: 199 pounds

### Exceptions

Some Americanisms are acceptable when they're industry standard:
- "Sign up" / "Sign in" (not "Register" / "Log in") - widely understood
- "Email" (not "e-mail") - standard modern usage
- "Website" (not "web site") - standard modern usage
- Technical jargon that's standardised with American spelling

### Automated Checking

When in doubt, prefer British spelling. Consider these resources:
- Oxford English Dictionary for British spellings
- Collins Dictionary
- Cambridge Dictionary

### AI Instructions

When generating or editing content:
1. Always default to British English for user-facing text
2. Keep code-related technical terms in American English
3. Double-check common American/British spelling differences
4. Maintain consistency across the entire codebase
5. When converting existing content, search for common American spellings systematically

## Code Style Preferences

Follow the existing code style preferences from the user's rules, with emphasis on:

### Type Safety First
- Prioritize type safety in all generated code
- For TypeScript projects, strictly enforce strong typing

### Concise and Readable Code
- Produce clean, well-formatted code
- Minimize unnecessary verbosity
- Aim for self-documenting code

### Context-Awareness
- Analyze existing project structure
- Ensure consistency with existing patterns
- Adhere to best practices

### Avoid Unnecessary Comments
- Do not include comments unless essential for explaining complex logic
- Explain reasoning and design choices in the response text, not as comments within generated code

## Editorial Standards for Course Content

### Voice and Authenticity

**Write as an experienced practitioner teaching a colleague—not generic AI.**

**Characteristics:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Concrete over abstract
- Direct and concise
- Natural rhythm and varied sentence structure

**AI Tells to Avoid:**
- "It is important to note that..." → Use "Note that..." or just state it
- "In conclusion," → Remove entirely
- "Overall," → Remove or be specific
- "On the other hand," → Use "However,"
- "Additionally," → Use "Also," or just continue
- "Furthermore," → Remove or restructure
- "utilize" → Use "use"
- Excessive qualifiers: "just", "simply", "basically", "really", "very"

### Technical Writing

**Pattern: Why → What → How**
1. Why does this matter?
2. What is the concept?
3. How do you use it?

**Code Comments:**
- Use sparingly
- Explain "why", not "what"
- Never state the obvious
- Use British English when explaining to users

**Examples:**
```javascript
// Good: Explains why
// Reset to 1 for accessibility - screen readers announce count
counter = counter + 1;

// Bad: States obvious
// Add 1 to counter
counter = counter + 1;
```

### Lesson Structure

Every lesson should have:
1. **Quick Summary** - One sentence takeaway
2. **What You'll Learn** - Bullet points of outcomes
3. **Main Content** - Teaching sections with clear headers
4. **Try It Yourself** - Practical exercises
5. **Test Your Understanding** - Quiz
6. **Key Takeaways** - Summary bullets
7. **Next Steps** - Link to next lesson

### Headers and Lists

**Headers:**
- Use sentence case, not Title Case
- Be specific: "Building a button" not "Buttons"
- Keep concise: 2-7 words ideal

**Lists:**
- Use parallel structure
- Keep items roughly equal length
- Aim for 3-7 items (cognitive limit)

### Accessibility

- Define jargon on first use
- Include fallbacks for visual content
- Always mention reduced motion preferences
- Consider performance on low-end devices
